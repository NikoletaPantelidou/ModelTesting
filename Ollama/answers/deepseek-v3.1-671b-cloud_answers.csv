B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Let’s break this down.  

Mary says:  
> ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""

We know from the context:  
- John is hungry.  
- There is pizza in the oven.  
- There is also pasta in the fridge.  

Mary’s statement is a conditional:  
**If P (John is hungry), then Q (there is pizza in the oven).**  

From the context, P is true and Q is true.  
When P is true and Q is true, the conditional statement ""If P then Q"" is **true**.  

But the question is:  
> Is it true that there is pizza in the oven?  

That’s just asking about Q.  
We know from the context (not just from Mary’s statement) that Q is true.  

So the answer is:  

**Yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.**"

**Given facts:**
1. John is hungry.  
2. There is no pizza in the oven.  
3. There is no pasta in the fridge.  

**Mary’s statement:**  
> ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""

In logical form:  
\[
\text{Hungry} \rightarrow \text{PizzaInOven}
\]
Where:  
- \( \text{Hungry} \) is **True** (given).  
- \( \text{PizzaInOven} \) is **False** (given).

**Truth table for implication \( P \rightarrow Q \):**  
- If \( P \) is True and \( Q \) is False, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) is **False**.  

So Mary’s statement is **false** given the actual situation.  

But the **question** is:

---

**Given facts:**
- John is **not hungry**.
- There is pasta in the fridge.
- Mary says: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""*

---

**Logical form of Mary’s statement:**  
Let \( H \) = ""John is hungry""  
Let \( P \) = ""There is pizza in the oven""  

Mary’s statement:  
\[
H \rightarrow P
\]

This is a **conditional statement**.  
It is **false** only when \( H \) is true and \( P \) is false.  
If \( H \) is false, the conditional is **true regardless of \( P \)**.

---

**Given \( H \) is false** (John is not hungry),  
\[
H \rightarrow P
\]
is **true** no matter whether \( P \) is true or false.

So Mary’s statement is **automatically true** given \( H \) is false, but it does **not** tell us whether \( P \) is true.

---

**Conclusion:**  
We cannot determine if there is pizza in the oven from the given information.  
Mary’s statement is **vacuously true** here, but it doesn’t guarantee \( P \).

B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Let’s break this down.  

Mary says:  
> ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""

We know from the context:  
- Nicole's head hurts.  
- There is aspirin on the table.  
- There is also ibuprofen in the drawer.  

The statement Mary made is a conditional:  
- **If P, then Q**, where:  
  P = ""Nicole's head hurts""  
  Q = ""There is aspirin on the table""  

We are told **P is true** (Nicole's head hurts).  
If P is true and the conditional ""If P then Q"" is true, then Q must be true.  

But here’s the subtlety:  
Mary’s statement being true doesn’t necessarily mean Q is true in reality — it only means that **if P is true, then Q is true**.  
However, in this scenario, we are told in the context that there *is* aspirin on the table, so Q is actually true in reality.  

But the question is:  
> Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?  

From Mary’s statement alone, we cannot conclude Q is true unless we also know P is true **and** we know Mary’s conditional is true.  
We do know P is true from the context, but the truth of Mary’s statement is not given — we only know she said it.  

If we assume Mary’s statement is true, then since P is true, Q must be true.  
But if we don’t assume Mary is telling the truth, then we can’t deduce Q from her statement.  

However, the problem seems to want us to use the given context facts directly:  
The context explicitly says ""There is aspirin on the table"" as a fact, so regardless of Mary’s statement, it is true.  

But the question says: **Based on what Mary says** — so we must be careful.  
If we only rely on Mary’s words: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"" — that by itself does not assert that Nicole’s head hurts; it’s just a conditional. Without the extra context fact (P is true), we couldn’t conclude Q. But here, the context is given separately, so maybe we are to use it.  

Given standard logic puzzles:  
- We know P is true (from context).  
- We are told Mary says ""If P then Q"".  
- If we take Mary’s statement as true, then Q is true.  
- The question likely expects: Yes, it is true (because P is true and the conditional holds).  

But if the puzzle is tricky, they might say: We don’t know if Mary’s statement is true, so we can’t deduce Q from it alone.  

However, since the context already states as a fact that there is aspirin on the table, the answer is **yes**, it is true — but not *solely* from Mary’s statement; from the context facts.  

Given the way such questions are usually interpreted in logic exercises:  
**Answer:** Yes, because Nicole’s head hurts (P true) and Mary’s conditional (if P then Q) is accepted as true, so Q follows.

Mary says:  
> ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""

We know from the context:  
- Nicole's head hurts.  
- There is no aspirin on the table.  

So the **if–then** statement Mary made is:  
- **If P, then Q**, where:  
  - P = ""Nicole's head hurts""  
  - Q = ""There is aspirin on the table""  

We know **P is true** (Nicole's head hurts) and **Q is false** (no aspirin on the table).  

That means Mary’s statement **""If P then Q""** is **false** in this situation.  

But the question is:

From the context, we know **there is no aspirin on the table**.

**Given facts:**
1. Nicole’s head does **not** hurt.

**We know \( H \) is false** (Nicole’s head does not hurt).

So we are in the last two rows of the table:  
- If \( H \) is false, \( H \rightarrow A \) is **true** regardless of whether \( A \) is true or false.

---

**Conclusion:**
Mary’s statement being true does **not** tell us whether \( A \) is true or false when \( H \) is false.  
We only know that if \( H \) were true, \( A \) would have to be true — but \( H \) is false, so \( A \) could be either.

Mary says:  
> ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""

This is a **conditional statement** of the form:  
If \( P \) (Lucy is thirsty), then \( Q \) (there is water in the fridge).  

We know from the context that:  
- \( P \) is true (Lucy is thirsty).  
- \( Q \) is true (there is water in the fridge).  

But the question is:  
> Is it true that there is water in the fridge?  

From the **context**, yes — there is water in the fridge.  

However, if we only rely on **Mary’s statement** and the fact that Lucy is thirsty, then by *modus ponens*:  
- If \( P \) then \( Q \).  
- \( P \) is true.  
- Therefore \( Q \) is true.  

So both from the given context and from logical deduction using Mary’s statement, the answer is **yes**.

Mary says:  
> ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""

We know from the context:  
- Lucy is thirsty.  
- There is **no** water in the fridge.  

So the statement ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"" is of the form:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]
where:  
- \(P\) = ""Lucy is thirsty"" (true)  
- \(Q\) = ""There is water in the fridge"" (false)  

In logic, \(P \rightarrow Q\) is **false** when \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.  
That’s exactly the case here: \(P\) true, \(Q\) false → the implication is **false**.  

But the question is:  
> Is it true that there is water in the fridge?  

We know from the context that **there is no water in the fridge**, regardless of what Mary’s (false) statement claims.

**Given facts:**
- Lucy is **not thirsty**.

**Logical form of Mary’s statement:**  
Let \( P \) = ""Lucy is thirsty""  
Let \( Q \) = ""There is water in the fridge""  

Mary’s statement: \( P \to Q \) (""If P, then Q"")

---

**Truth value of \( P \to Q \):**  
We know \( P \) is false (Lucy is not thirsty).  
In logic, \( P \to Q \) is **true** when \( P \) is false, regardless of \( Q \).  

So Mary’s statement is **true** in the actual situation, because the antecedent \( P \) is false.

---

**Does it mean \( Q \) is true?**  
No.  
From \( P \to Q \) being true and \( P \) being false, we cannot determine \( Q \).  
\( Q \) could be true or false; the implication would still be true.

Mary says:  
> ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""

We know from the context:  
- Peter’s phone is dead.  
- There is a charger in the drawer.  
- There is a computer on the table.  

The statement Mary made is a conditional:  
\[
\text{If } P \text{ then } Q
\]
where:  
- \( P \): Peter’s phone is dead.  
- \( Q \): There is a charger in the drawer.  

We are told \( P \) is true, and \( Q \) is also true.  
So \( P \to Q \) is **true** (since T → T is true).  

The question is:  
> Is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?  

That’s asking: Is \( Q \) true?  

From the context, \( Q \) is **true** (it’s stated as a fact in the context).  
Mary’s statement being true doesn’t *prove* \( Q \) from logic alone without \( P \), but here \( P \) is true, so \( Q \) must be true for Mary’s statement to hold.  
But actually, the context already says \( Q \) is true directly.

---

**Step 1: Restating the facts from the context**  
- Peter’s phone is dead.  
- There is no charger in the drawer.  
- There is no computer on the table.  

These are given as *actual facts* in the scenario.

---

**Step 2: Mary’s statement**

**Step 3: Truth value of \(P\) and \(Q\) from the context**  
From the context:  
- \(P\) is **true** (phone is dead).  
- \(Q\) is **false** (no charger in drawer).

---

**Step 4: Evaluate Mary’s statement given the facts**  
A conditional \(P \rightarrow Q\) is false **only** when \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.  
Here, \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false, so \(P \rightarrow Q\) is **false**.

That means Mary’s statement is **false** in this situation.

---

**Step 5: What does that mean for the question?**  
The question asks:  
> Is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?

We already know from the context: there is **no** charger in the drawer.  
So the answer is **no**.

Mary’s statement being false doesn’t change the actual fact about the charger.  
It only tells us Mary’s claim is wrong.

Mary says:  
> ""If Peter’s phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""

We know from the context:

The statement is a conditional:  
- **If P, then Q**  
  where P = ""Peter’s phone is dead""  
  Q = ""There is a charger in the drawer""  

In logic, if P is false, the conditional ""If P then Q"" is **true** regardless of whether Q is true or false.  

So Mary’s statement is **true** in this situation (since P is false), but that doesn’t tell us whether Q is actually true.

In logical form:

In logic, this is a conditional statement:

From the context, we know:  
- The weather is **sunny**, so it is **not rainy**.  
- A **raincoat** being in the car doesn’t affect the truth of Mary’s statement.  

In logic, if the antecedent (""weather is rainy"") is false, the conditional statement is **true** regardless of whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack.  
So Mary’s statement is **true** in this situation (sunny weather).  

But the **question** is:

The question asks:

---

**Context:**
- The plant is **not dry**.
- There is a hose in the garden.
- Mary says: *""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.""*

---

**Logical form of Mary’s statement:**  
Let \( P = \) ""the plant is dry""  
Let \( Q = \) ""there is a water can on the shelf""  

Mary says:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]

---

**Given:** \( P \) is false (the plant is **not dry**).

In logic, \( P \rightarrow Q \) is **true** when \( P \) is false, regardless of \( Q \).  
So Mary’s statement is **automatically true** given the fact that \( P \) is false.

**But** the question is: *Is it true that there is a water can on the shelf?*

That is: Is \( Q \) true?

From \( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( \neg P \), we **cannot** conclude \( Q \).  
We only know Mary’s statement is **true**, but that doesn’t tell us whether \( Q \) is true or false.

**Conclusion:**  
We do **not** have enough information to determine if there is a water can on the shelf.  
So the answer is: **Not necessarily** — it’s **unknown** based on the given information.

2. \( \text{Wrinkled} \) (fact given in context)

So, **yes**, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary says:  
> ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""

In logic:  
Let \( P \) = ""George's shirt is wrinkled""  
Let \( Q \) = ""There is an iron in the closet""  

Mary’s statement: \( P \rightarrow Q \)  

We know from the context:  
- \( P \) is true (shirt is wrinkled)  
- \( Q \) is unknown from Mary’s statement alone, but the context says: ""there is no iron in the closet"" (so \( Q \) is false).  

If \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is false, then \( P \rightarrow Q \) would be false.  
But Mary said \( P \rightarrow Q \) as if it were true.  

The **question** is:  
> Is it true that there is an iron in the closet?  

From Mary’s statement alone, we cannot conclude \( Q \) is true, because \( P \rightarrow Q \) being true does not tell us \( Q \) is true unless \( P \) is true — but here \( P \) is true, so from \( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( P \), we can deduce \( Q \) **if Mary’s statement is true**.  

But the context says \( Q \) is false (no iron in closet).  
So Mary’s statement is actually false in reality.  

But the question seems to ask: **Based on what Mary says**, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?  

If we take Mary’s statement as a true fact, and we know \( P \) is true, then yes, \( Q \) must be true.  

But if we take the real-world facts (shirt wrinkled, no iron), Mary’s statement is false, so we can’t rely on it to conclude \( Q \).  

Since the question says **""Based on what Mary says""**, I think we must assume Mary’s statement is correct for the sake of the reasoning.  

Thus:  
- Mary says: \( P \rightarrow Q \)  
- We observe \( P \) is true  
- Therefore \( Q \) is true.

**Given facts:**
1. George’s shirt is **not wrinkled**.
2. There is an ironing board on the balcony (likely irrelevant to the logic here).
3. Mary says:  
   *If George’s shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.*  
   In logical form:

   W \rightarrow I
   \]  
   where \( W \) = “George’s shirt is wrinkled” (false)  
   and \( I \) = “There is an iron in the closet” (truth value unknown).

---

**Logical analysis:**
- \( W \) is false.
- For an implication \( W \rightarrow I \), if \( W \) is false, the implication is **true** regardless of \( I \).
- So Mary’s statement is **vacuously true** given the facts.
- But that doesn’t tell us whether \( I \) is true or false; it only tells us that Mary’s statement is consistent with the facts.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  The context states: ""Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more."" The fact that people buy more pizza *even though* it costs more is a strong indicator of higher popularity.
2.  The second sentence, ""There is pizza in the fridge,"" supports the idea that pizza is a commonly purchased and consumed item in this specific scenario.

Therefore, the evidence in the context points to pizza being more popular than pasta."
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?","Let’s break this down.  

The context says:  

> Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more.  

That means pizza is bought more often than pasta, despite being more expensive.  

Then it says:  

> There is pizza in the fridge.  

That’s just an extra fact, not directly about popularity.  

The question is:  

> Is pasta more popular than pizza?  

If pizza is bought more than pasta, then pizza is more popular (assuming “popular” means “bought more often” in this context).  

So pasta is **not** more popular than pizza.

F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","Let’s break this down.  

The context says:  
- Black coffee is cheaper than green tea.  
- Most people prefer green tea.  
- There is black coffee in the pot.  

The question is: **Is green tea more used than black coffee?**  

From the statement “most people prefer green tea,” we can infer that if preference translates to usage, then green tea would be more used.  
However, the context doesn’t explicitly state usage — only preference and relative price.  

Still, in common reasoning, if most people prefer green tea, it’s likely they consume (use) it more, unless there’s some barrier (like availability or cost).  
Here, green tea is more expensive, but preference is still stronger for it, so likely yes — green tea is more used.  

**Answer:** Yes."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","Let’s break this down.  

The context says:  

1. Black coffee is cheaper than green tea.  
2. Most people prefer green tea.  
3. There is black coffee in the pot.  

The question asks: *Is black coffee more used than green tea?*  

From the context, we know **most people prefer green tea**, which suggests that green tea is more popular.  
However, the question is about **usage**, not preference or cost.  

The only usage clue is: ""There is black coffee in the pot"" — but that doesn’t tell us about comparative usage, only that black coffee is currently available.  

Given that most people prefer green tea, it’s reasonable to infer that green tea is more used, unless there’s some other constraint (like availability, cost) that would make people use black coffee more often despite preference. But the context doesn’t give that extra info.  

So the most logical answer based on preference (most people prefer green tea) is:  

**No, black coffee is not more used than green tea.**

The context says:  

> Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven.  

From this, we know:  

- Broccoli is used more than gnocchi.  
- “Used more” could mean more frequently or in greater quantities.  
- Popularity could be measured by frequency of use.  

So, if people use broccoli more than gnocchi, then broccoli is more popular in terms of usage.

The context says:  

> Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven.  

The key part is: “people use it more” — “it” refers to broccoli.

The context says:  
- Bananas are more expensive than kiwis.  
- People purchase bananas more (despite the higher price).  
- There are bananas in the basket.

F7T,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are dogs more popular than cats?","Let’s break this down.  

The context says:  

> Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree.  

The word “them” in “people prefer them” is ambiguous — it could refer to dogs or cats.  
- If “them” refers to “dogs,” then people prefer dogs, so dogs would be more popular.  
- If “them” refers to “cats,” then people prefer cats, so cats would be more popular.  

Usually, in the structure “Although X, people prefer Y,” the pronoun “them” after “prefer” refers back to the noun in the *first* part of the contrast. But here, the first part is “dogs are more lively than cats,” so “them” could refer to “cats” because “cats” is the object of comparison and often in such “Although X is true about A compared to B, people prefer B” constructions, “them” refers to B.  

Let’s test:  
> Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer cats.  
That makes sense — the contrast is between dogs being more lively (a positive) but people preferring cats anyway.  

So in this context, “people prefer them” means people prefer cats.  

Thus, **dogs are not more popular than cats** — cats are preferred.  

**Answer:** No."
F7F,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are cats more popular than dogs?","Let’s break this down.  

The context says:  

> Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them.  

The word “them” here is ambiguous — it could refer to *dogs* or *cats*. Usually, “Although X, people prefer Y” means Y is preferred despite X’s quality.  
So:  
- Dogs are more lively.  
- But people prefer *them* (likely cats, because “although” sets up a contrast with the first idea).  

Then: “There is a cat up in the tree.” (This is extra info but doesn’t change preference.)  

So the implication: People prefer cats over dogs.  

Thus, to the question: **Are cats more popular than dogs?**  
Yes, according to the context, people prefer cats, so cats are more popular.  

**Answer:** Yes."

The context says:  

> Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV.  

This means that out of the total number of people being considered (presumably people who either read books or watch TV, or both), the majority are watching TV.  

The next sentence says:  

> There is a book on the shelf.  

That doesn’t change the fact about the comparison of people’s habits.  

So, the statement “more people watch TV than read books” is supported by the phrase “most people watch TV” (which implies that the number of people watching TV is greater than the number of people reading books).

**2. Truth value of \(P\):**

We know \(P\) is **false** (parrot is not in the cage).

- \(P\) true and \(T\) true → true  
- \(P\) true and \(T\) false → false  
- \(P\) false and \(T\) true → true

But Mary’s statement only tells us what *she* said would happen if you finished the broccoli. It doesn’t guarantee that Mark actually gave you the candy — it only says that according to Mary, he would.  

The problem says:  
> Mary did not give you a candy.  

That’s irrelevant to Mark’s action.  

However, the question is:  
> Is it true that Mark gave you a candy?  

We don’t have direct information about whether Mark actually gave you a candy. Mary’s statement being true or false is separate from whether Mark actually did it.  

Since the only info about Mark’s action comes from Mary’s prediction, and we don’t know if Mary’s prediction was correct, we cannot conclude that Mark gave you a candy.  

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Let’s break it down.  

Mary’s statement:  
> ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""

This is a conditional statement:  
- **If P, then Q**  
where:  
P = ""you finish your broccoli""  
Q = ""Mark will give you a candy""  

From the context:  
- You did **not** finish your broccoli (P is false).  

In logic, if P is false, the statement ""If P, then Q"" is **vacuously true** regardless of Q.  
That means Mary’s promise doesn’t tell us anything about whether Mark gave you candy when P is false.  

So, based **only** on Mary’s statement and the fact that P is false, we **cannot conclude** that Mark gave you a candy.  

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Let’s break it down.

1. **Facts given:**  
   - The foxes are dancing.  
   - The squirrels are eating.  
   - Mary said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""

2. **Logical form:**  
   Mary’s statement:  
   \[
   \text{Foxes dancing} \implies \text{Susan gets a camera}
   \]  
   This is a conditional statement.

3. **Truth of the antecedent:**  
   We know ""The foxes are dancing"" is true.

4. **Implication rule:**  
   If \(P \implies Q\) and \(P\) is true, then \(Q\) must be true for the implication to hold.  
   But here, we don’t know if Mary’s statement itself is true — we only know Mary *said* it.  

5. **Key point:**  
   The problem doesn’t say Mary’s statement is true; it only says she said it.  
   So even though the foxes are dancing, we cannot conclude Susan got a camera unless we assume Mary was telling the truth.  
   Since the context doesn’t state Mary’s statement is true, we can’t deduce Susan got a camera.

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true that Susan got a camera."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Let’s break this down.  

**Given:**
1. The foxes are dancing.  
2. The squirrels are eating.  
3. Susan did not get a shovel.  
4. Mary said: *""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""*  

We are asked: *Is it true that Susan got a camera?*

---

**Step 1: Interpret Mary’s statement**  
Mary’s statement:  
> If the foxes are dancing, then Susan will get a camera.  

In logical form:  
\[
\text{Foxes dancing} \rightarrow \text{Susan gets a camera}.
\]

---

**Step 2: Check the antecedent**  
From the context: ""The foxes are dancing"" is true.  

So the antecedent of Mary’s conditional is **true**.

---

**Step 3: Apply modus ponens**  
If \( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( P \) is true, then \( Q \) must be true.  
So Susan must get a camera.

---

**Step 4: Check for relevance of other facts**  
- ""Squirrels are eating"" — irrelevant to Mary’s statement.  
- ""Susan did not get a shovel"" — irrelevant to the camera implication.  

No other information contradicts the conclusion from Mary’s statement.

---

**Step 5: Conclusion**  
Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

\[
\boxed{\text{Yes}}

---

**1. Restating the facts:**

- Foxes are **not** dancing.  
- Squirrels are **not** eating.  
- Mary’s statement:  
  > ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""

In logical form:  
\[
\text{Foxes dancing} \implies \text{Susan gets a camera}.
\]

---

**2. Logical implication rule:**

An implication \( P \implies Q \) is **false** only when \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is false.  
If \( P \) is false, the implication is **true** regardless of \( Q \).

Here:  
\( P \) = ""Foxes are dancing"" = **false** (given in context).  
So \( P \implies Q \) is **true** no matter whether Susan got a camera or not.

---

**3. Can we determine if Susan got a camera?**

From \( P \) false, we **cannot** conclude \( Q \) is true or false.  
We only know the conditional statement Mary made is **vacuously true** given the facts, but \( Q \) could be either way.

---

**4. Conclusion:**

We do **not** have enough information to say ""Susan got a camera"" is **true**.  
The answer is: **No, it is not necessarily true** (it might be true or false, but we can’t affirm it from the given information).

S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Let’s break it down.

**Given:**
1. The TV is on.
2. The radio is on.
3. Mary said: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""*

We are **not told** whether Mary’s statement is true or false — we only know she said it.  
The question asks: *Is it true that Matthew baked cookies?*

---

**Logical analysis:**
- Mary’s statement is: \( TV \rightarrow \text{Matthew bakes cookies} \)
- We know \( TV \) is on (true).
- But we don’t know if Mary’s conditional statement is true in reality.  
  It could be that Mary’s prediction is false, meaning the conditional is false, which would require \( TV \) true and Matthew not baking cookies.

Since we only know the TV is on, but not whether Mary’s statement is **true**, we cannot conclude Matthew baked cookies.

---

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true that Matthew baked cookies.  
We cannot determine it from the given information."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Let’s break it down.

**Given facts:**
1. The TV is on.  
2. The radio is on.  
3. Matthew did not bake cookies.  
4. Mary said: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""*

---

**Step 1: Interpret Mary’s statement.**  
Mary’s statement is:  
> If the TV is on, then Matthew will bake cookies.  

In logical form:  
\[
\text{TV on} \rightarrow \text{Matthew bakes cookies}.
\]

---

**Step 2: Check the truth of the antecedent and consequent.**  
From facts:  
- TV is on → antecedent is **True**.  
- Matthew did not bake cookies → consequent is **False**.

---

**Step 3: Evaluate the conditional statement given the facts.**  
A conditional \(P \rightarrow Q\) is **false** when \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.  
Here: \(P\) = True, \(Q\) = False, so \(P \rightarrow Q\) is **False**.

---

**Step 4: What is the question asking?**  
The question is:  
> Is it true that Matthew baked cookies?  

We know from the facts: Matthew did **not** bake cookies.  
So the answer to ""Is it true that Matthew baked cookies?"" is **No**.

---

**Step 5: But is there a trick?**  
The problem might be trying to see if we use Mary’s statement to deduce Matthew baked cookies.  
But Mary’s statement is **false** given the facts, so we can’t use it to derive anything.  
We just use the given fact: Matthew did not bake cookies.

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{No}}

S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Let’s reason through this step by step.  

**1. Restating the facts**  
- TV is off.  
- Radio is off.  
- Mary said: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""*  
  - In logical form: \( TV\ \text{on} \rightarrow \text{Matthew bakes cookies} \)  

---

**2. Understanding the implication**  
An implication \( P \rightarrow Q \) is **false** only when \( P \) is true and \( Q \) is false.  
If \( P \) is false, the implication is **true** regardless of \( Q \).  

Here:  
\( P \): TV is on  
\( Q \): Matthew bakes cookies  

We know \( P \) is false (TV is off).  
So \( P \rightarrow Q \) is **true** no matter what \( Q \) is.  

---

**3. What can we conclude about Matthew baking cookies?**  
From \( P \) being false, we **cannot** determine \( Q \).  
The statement only tells us what happens *if* the TV is on.  
Since the TV is not on, the statement gives no constraint on whether Matthew bakes cookies.  

---

**4. Answer to the question**  
The question: *""Is it true that Matthew baked cookies?""*  
We have no information that confirms or denies Matthew baked cookies.  
So the answer is: **We don’t know** (it is not necessarily true, nor is it necessarily false).

S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Let’s break this down.

---

**1. Restating the facts from the context:**

- Weather today: sunny, no wind.
- Mary said: *""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""*

We are told Mary said this, but we are **not** told that Mary’s statement is *true* in general — we are only told she said it.

---

**2. Logical form of Mary’s statement:**

Mary’s statement is:  
\[
\text{If } P \text{ then } Q
\]
where  
\(P\) = ""weather is sunny""  
\(Q\) = ""Emma wears purple""

In logic, \(P \to Q\) is **true** unless \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.

---

**3. Applying the facts:**

We know \(P\) is true (weather is sunny).  
So for Mary’s statement to be *true*, \(Q\) must be true (Emma wears purple).  
But we don’t know if Mary’s statement is true — we only know she *said* it.

So from the given context, we cannot conclude \(Q\) is true unless we assume Mary’s statement is true.

---

**4. Do we know Mary’s statement is true?**

The context does **not** say Mary’s statement is a fact; it just says Mary said it.  
So we cannot deduce \(Q\) from \(P\) alone without assuming the conditional is true.

Since the question asks: *""Is it true that Emma wore purple?""* — the only way to answer ""yes"" is if we assume Mary’s prediction is correct. But the problem doesn’t give us that assumption explicitly.

---

**5. Conclusion:**

Given the information, we cannot be sure Emma wore purple.  
The weather being sunny only makes the antecedent true, but without knowing Mary’s statement is reliable, we can’t deduce Emma wore purple.

So the answer is:

\[
\boxed{\text{No}}

We cannot conclude it is true that Emma wore purple based only on the information given."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Let’s break it down.  

Mary said:  
> ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""

We know:  
- The weather is sunny today.  
- Emma is wearing green.  

From logic:  
- The statement ""If P, then Q"" (P = sunny, Q = Emma wears purple) means: **when P is true, Q must be true** for the whole statement to be true.  
- Here, P is true (sunny), but Q is false (Emma wears green, not purple).  

So the **actual situation** violates Mary’s prediction.  
That means Mary’s statement is **false** in reality.  

But the question asks:  
> Is it true that Emma wore purple?  

Given the facts: Emma wore green, not purple.  

**Answer:** No, it is not true that Emma wore purple.  

\[
\boxed{\text{No}}

S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Let’s break this down.

> ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""

This is a conditional statement:  
**Sunny → Wear purple**  

We know:  
- Today’s weather: rainy and windy.  
- That means it is **not sunny**.  

In logic, if the antecedent (""weather is sunny"") is false, the conditional **Sunny → Purple** is **true regardless** of whether Emma wears purple or not.  
So we cannot conclude from Mary’s statement alone whether Emma wore purple — her statement only tells us what happens if it’s sunny.  

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true that Emma wore purple. We don’t have enough information."

The statement is of the form:  
**If P, then Q**  
where:  
P = ""playground is empty""  
Q = ""Angela will take a selfie""  

We are told **P is true**.  
If P is true, then according to Mary’s statement, Q must be true.  

So, based **only on Mary’s statement and the fact that P is true**, we can conclude:  
**Yes, it is true that Angela took a selfie.**  

Final answer:  

**Yes.**"
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Let's break it down.  

**Given facts:**
1. The playground is empty.  
2. The streets are quiet.  
3. Angela did not take a selfie.  
4. Mary said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""

---

**Step 1 – Interpret Mary’s statement**  
Mary’s statement is a conditional:  
\[
\text{If (playground is empty), then (Angela takes a selfie)}.
\]  
In logical form: \( P \rightarrow A \), where  
\(P\) = ""playground is empty"" = true (from given facts)  
\(A\) = ""Angela takes a selfie"" = false (from given facts)  

---

**Step 2 – Truth value of Mary’s statement**  
We check \(P \rightarrow A\):  
If \(P\) is true and \(A\) is false, then \(P \rightarrow A\) is **false**.  

So Mary’s statement is **false** according to the facts.

---

**Step 3 – What the question asks**  
The question is: ""Is it true that Angela took a selfie?""  
From the given facts: Angela did **not** take a selfie.  
So the answer is **no**.

Mary’s statement:  
> ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""

In logical form:  
**If P, then Q**

P = ""playground is empty""  
Q = ""Angela will take a selfie""

We are told:  
- The playground is crowded (so P is **false**).  
- The streets are lively (irrelevant to the conditional statement).

In logic, when the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional ""If P, then Q"" is **true** regardless of Q.  
That means Mary’s statement is **true** in this situation, but it doesn’t tell us whether Q happened or not.

Since P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q from Mary’s statement alone.

From the context:  
- The lawn has been mowed.  
- But we don’t know **who** mowed the lawn.  

The conditional statement only guarantees Paul gets 50 euros **if Paul mowed the lawn**.  
If someone else mowed the lawn, the condition isn’t triggered for Paul.  

Since we don’t know that Paul mowed it, we **cannot** conclude that Paul got 50 euros.  

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Let’s break this down.

---

**1. Restating the facts from the context:**

- The lawn has been mowed.  
- The flowers have been watered.  
- Paul did not get 50 euros.  
- Mary said: *""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""*

We are asked: *Is it true that Paul got 50 euros?*

---

**2. Understanding Mary’s statement**

Mary’s statement is:  
> If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.

In logical form:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]
where:  
\(P\) = Paul mows the lawn  
\(Q\) = Paul gets 50 euros.

---

**3. Applying known facts**

We know:  
- The lawn has been mowed.  
- But it is **not** stated that *Paul* mowed it.  
- So \(P\) could be false.

If \(P\) is false, then \(P \rightarrow Q\) is **true** regardless of \(Q\).  
So Mary’s statement can be true even if Paul did not get 50 euros.

---

**4. Do we know who mowed the lawn?**

The context says: ""The lawn has been mowed"" and ""Paul did not get 50 euros"".  
It does **not** say Paul mowed the lawn.  
So we cannot assume \(P\) is true.

---

**5. What does the question ask?**

The question is: ""Is it true that Paul got 50 euros?""  
We know from the context: ""Paul did not get 50 euros.""  
So the answer is simply: **No, it is false that Paul got 50 euros.**

---

**6. Could there be a trick with the conditional?**

Sometimes these puzzles try to trick by making you think:  
""Mary said: If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros. The lawn is mowed, so he should get 50 euros.""  
But that’s the fallacy of affirming the consequent.  
Mary’s statement doesn’t say *only Paul* mows the lawn, and it doesn’t say mowing the lawn is the only way to get 50 euros, but more importantly:  
We already know Paul did not get 50 euros, so the factual answer is straightforward.

---

**Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{\text{No}}
\]"
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Let’s break this down.  

Mary said:  
> ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""

This is a conditional statement:  
- **If** Paul mows the lawn → **then** he gets 50 euros.  

From the context:  
- The lawn has not been mowed.  

So the condition ""Paul mows the lawn"" is **false**.  

In logic, when the ""if"" part of a conditional is false, the statement as a whole is **vacuously true**, but it doesn’t tell us whether the ""then"" part happened.  
We only know that if he had mowed the lawn, he would have gotten 50 euros.  
Since he didn’t mow it, we cannot conclude he got the money.  

Therefore:

So Mary’s statement is **false** in reality.  
But the question asks: **Is it true that Amy brought donuts?**

We know from premise 3: Amy did **not** bring donuts.  
So the answer is **no**.

---

\[
\boxed{\text{No}}
\]"
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Let’s break this down.

---

**1. Restating the facts from context:**
- The fridge is full.  
- The oven is on.  
- Mary said: *""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""*

In logical terms, Mary’s statement is:  
\[
\text{Fridge is empty} \rightarrow \text{Amy brings donuts}
\]
This is a conditional statement \(P \rightarrow Q\), where:  
\(P\) = ""fridge is empty""  
\(Q\) = ""Amy brings donuts""

---

**2. What we know about \(P\):**
The fridge is **full**, so \(P\) is **false**.

---

**3. Logical implication \(P \rightarrow Q\) when \(P\) is false:**
For \(P \rightarrow Q\), if \(P\) is false, the implication is **true** regardless of \(Q\).  
That means Mary’s statement is **true** in this situation, but it does **not** tell us whether \(Q\) is true or false.

---

**4. Can we determine if Amy brought donuts?**
No — from \(P\) being false, we cannot conclude \(Q\) is true or false.  
We only know: the implication is **vacuously true** because the condition ""fridge is empty"" is false.

---

**5. Conclusion:**
We have no information that tells us Amy brought donuts.  
The only way to conclude she brought donuts from Mary’s statement would be if the fridge were empty, but it’s not.

**Contexto:**
- Joan tiene hambre.
- Hay pizza en el horno.
- Hay pasta en la nevera.
- María dice: ""Si Joan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"".

**Análisis lógico:**
- La frase de María es una implicación:  
  \( P \): Joan tiene hambre.  
  \( Q \): Hay pizza en el horno.  
  María dice: \( P \to Q \).

Sabemos que \( P \) es verdadero (Joan tiene hambre) y \( Q \) es verdadero (hay pizza en el horno).  
Por lo tanto, \( P \to Q \) es **verdadero** (una implicación es verdadera si el antecedente y el consecuente son verdaderos).

**Pregunta:** ¿Es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?  
No nos están preguntando si la frase de María es verdadera, sino si \( Q \) es verdadero.  
Según el contexto dado explícitamente: ""Hay pizza al forn"" es un hecho del contexto, independiente de lo que diga María.

**Respuesta:**
Sí, es verdad que hay pizza en el horno, porque el contexto lo afirma directamente.

**Respuesta final:**  
Sí."
B1F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i no hi ha pizza al forn. Tampoc no hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Vamos a analizar la situación paso a paso.

---

**1. Contexto:**

- Joan tiene hambre.
- No hay pizza en el horno.
- No hay pasta en la nevera.
- María dice: *""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn""* (Si Joan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno).

---

**2. Lo que sabemos:**

- Joan tiene hambre → **Verdadero** (del contexto).
- María dice: \( P \rightarrow Q \), donde:
  - \( P \): ""Joan tiene hambre"" (**Verdadero**)
  - \( Q \): ""Hay pizza en el horno"" (desconocemos su valor de verdad al principio, pero el contexto nos dice que es **Falso** porque dice ""no hay pizza al forn"").

---

**3. Evaluar la implicación \( P \rightarrow Q \):**

- \( P \) es **Verdadero**, \( Q \) es **Falso**.
- \( V \rightarrow F \) es **Falso**.
- Por lo tanto, lo que dice María es **Falso** en la situación real.

---

**4. Interpretación de la pregunta:**

La pregunta es: *""És veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?""* (¿Es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?).

- Sabemos que **no** hay pizza en el horno (contexto dado).
- Por lo tanto, la respuesta es **No**.

---

**5. Conclusión:**

La frase de María es una implicación que resulta falsa en este caso, pero la pregunta no es sobre la verdad de lo que dice María, sino sobre la realidad: ¿hay pizza en el horno? La realidad es que no.

---

**Respuesta final:** No."

B2T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","Vamos a analizar la situación paso a paso.

1. **Contexto dado**:
   - Núria tiene dolor de cabeza.
   - Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.
   - También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón.
   - María dice: *""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""* (es decir, ""Si Núria tiene dolor de cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"").

2. **Lo que sabemos**:
   - La frase de María es una condicional \( P \rightarrow Q \), donde:
     - \( P \): Núria tiene dolor de cabeza.
     - \( Q \): Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.
   - Sabemos que \( P \) es verdadero (por el contexto) y \( Q \) es verdadero (también por el contexto).
   - Por lo tanto, la condicional \( P \rightarrow Q \) es verdadera (puesto que verdadero → verdadero es verdadero).

3. **La pregunta**:
   - ""És veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?"" (¿Es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?).
   - Según el contexto, **sí** es verdad, porque se dice explícitamente: ""hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"".

4. **Conclusión**:
   - La afirmación de María es cierta, pero la pregunta no se refiere a si lo que dice María es cierto, sino a si es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.
   - El contexto ya nos dice que sí.

**Respuesta**: Sí, es veritat."
B2F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. Tampoc no hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","Vamos a analizar la situación paso a paso.

**Contexto:**
1. Núria tiene dolor de cabeza.
2. No hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.
3. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón.
4. María dice: *""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""* (es decir: *Si Núria tiene dolor de cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa*).

---

**Análisis lógico:**

La frase de María es una condicional:  
\[
P: \text{Núria tiene dolor de cabeza} \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q: \text{Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa}.
\]

Sabemos que \(P\) es verdadero (por el contexto, Núria sí tiene dolor de cabeza).  
Sabemos que \(Q\) es falso (por el contexto, no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa).

Una condicional \(P \to Q\) es falsa solo cuando \(P\) es verdadero y \(Q\) es falso.  
Aquí, \(P\) es verdadero y \(Q\) es falso, entonces la condicional **es falsa**.

---

**Pero** la pregunta no es si lo que dice María es verdad, sino:

> ""Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?""

Es decir: *Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?*

María dice: *Si Núria tiene dolor de cabeza, entonces hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.*  
Ella no afirma que haya aspirinas; solo afirma una relación condicional.  
Como la condicional es falsa en la realidad, María está diciendo algo falso, pero eso no nos da información sobre si ella afirma que hay aspirinas.  

De hecho, en lógica, de \(P \to Q\) y \(P\) verdadero, se deduce \(Q\) (modus ponens).  
Si aceptáramos como verdadero lo que dice María (\(P \to Q\)) y supiéramos \(P\) cierto, entonces \(Q\) sería cierto.  
Pero aquí lo que dice María es falso, así que no podemos usar modus ponens para concluir \(Q\).

---

**Interpretación final:**
La pregunta pide: *Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?*  
Si ""según lo que dice María"" significa ""deduciendo a partir de su afirmación y los hechos que ella cree"", no podemos deducirlo, porque su afirmación es falsa.  
Pero si lo interpretamos como: ""María dice: Si P entonces Q; y P es verdad, luego Q es verdad"" (aplicando la lógica a su enunciado), entonces **según su enunciado** (si fuera verdadero) se deduciría que hay aspirinas.  

Pero en el contexto, como sabemos que su enunciado es falso, la inferencia no es válida en la realidad. Sin embargo, la pregunta parece ser de lógica literal:  
Dado que María afirma \(P \to Q\) y \(P\) es verdad, **según su afirmación** se sigue \(Q\).  

Pero en este caso, como \(P\) es verdad y \(Q\) es falso, su afirmación es falsa, así que no podemos concluir \(Q\) en el mundo real.  
Pero si la pregunta es: ""María dice: Si P entonces Q. P es verdad. Luego, ¿Q es verdad según María?"" —> Sí, porque si ella afirma un condicional y acepta el antecedente, está comprometida con el consecuente.

---

**Respuesta final:**
Si asumimos que María afirma un condicional y que el antecedente es verdadero (según los hechos), entonces, **según lo que dice María**, se deduce que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.  
Pero en la realidad no las hay, por lo que su afirmación es falsa.

La respuesta a la pregunta tal y como está formulada (""Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que..."") es **Sí**, porque según su declaración, si P es verdad, Q debe ser verdad.

1. **Contexto dado**:  
   - La Núria no té mal de cap.  
   - Hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix.  
   - La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"".

2. **Lógica de la frase de la Maria**:  
   La frase es una implicación:  
   \[
   P: \text{""Núria té mal de cap""} \quad \Rightarrow \quad Q: \text{""Hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""}
   \]
   En lógica, una implicación \( P \to Q \) es verdadera si \( P \) es falsa, independientemente de \( Q \).  
   Aquí \( P \) es falso (porque la Núria no té mal de cap).  
   Por tanto, la frase de la Maria es **verdadera** (no la ha mentido), pero eso no nos dice si \( Q \) es cierto.

3. **Pregunta**:  
   ""És veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?""  
   Es decir, ¿es cierto \( Q \)?  

4. **Conclusión**:  
   Del hecho de que \( P \) sea falsa, no podemos deducir nada sobre \( Q \).

**4. Sabem que \( P \) és fals (La Llúcia no té set).**

Així, estem en les files 3 o 4 de la taula: \( P \) fals.

- Si \( P \) és fals, \( P \rightarrow Q \) **és vertadera** independentment de \( Q \).

Per tant, la Maria diu la veritat (la seva frase és certa) tant si hi ha aigua a la nevera com si no n’hi ha.

**5. Conclusió:**

El fet que la Maria digui una frase vertadera quan \( P \) és fals **no ens dóna informació sobre \( Q \)**.

La Maria diu: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","Analitzem l’enunciat pas a pas.  

1. Sabem que la roda del cotxe està punxada (és un fet donat en el context).  
2. La Maria diu: *""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge""*.  
   Això és una condicional: \( P \rightarrow Q \), on  
   \( P \): ""la roda del cotxe està punxada""  
   \( Q \): ""hi ha un inflador al garatge""  

3. En lògica, per a \( P \rightarrow Q \) ser veritat quan \( P \) és veritat, cal que \( Q \) sigui veritat.  
   Com que la Maria diu aquesta condicional i se suposa que diu la veritat (la pregunta diu ""Segons el que diu la Maria""), aleshores si \( P \) és cert, \( Q \) ha de ser cert.  

4. Però el context també diu: *""no hi ha cap inflador al garatge""* (és un fet real).  
   Això vol dir que \( Q \) és fals.  

5. Si \( P \) és cert i \( Q \) és fals, llavors \( P \rightarrow Q \) és fals.  
   Però la Maria ha dit \( P \rightarrow Q \) i suposadament diu la veritat.  
   Hi ha contradicció: els fets del context mostren que el que diu la Maria és fals.  

6. Per tant, si la Maria està dient la veritat, no pot ser que \( P \) sigui cert i \( Q \) fals.  
   Com que \( P \) és cert (roda punxada), l’única manera que \( P \rightarrow Q \) sigui veritat és que \( Q \) sigui cert.  
   Però el context real diu que \( Q \) és fals.  

Així doncs, **segons el que diu la Maria**, ella estaria afirmant una implicació que, en realitat, és falsa.  
Però la pregunta no és ""La Maria diu la veritat?"", sinó:  

> ""És veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?""

I el context ens diu clarament: *""no hi ha cap inflador al garatge""*.  

Per tant, independentment del que digui la Maria, el fet és que **no hi ha inflador**.  

**Resposta:** No."
B6C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La roda del cotxe està inflada. Hi ha una bicicleta a la porta d'entrada. La Maria diu: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","Vamos a analizar la afirmación de Maria:

Esto es una implicación lógica:  
**Si P, entonces Q**

P = ""la roda del cotxe està punxada""  
Q = ""hi ha un inflador al garatge""  

Sabemos por el contexto:  
- La roda del cotxe està inflada (no está pinchada), es decir, **P es falsa**.  

En lógica, una implicación ""Si P entonces Q"" es **verdadera** cuando P es falsa, sin importar el valor de Q.  
Por lo tanto, la afirmación de Maria es **verdadera** en esta situación, pero eso no nos dice si Q es verdadero o falso.  

La pregunta es:  
> És veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?  

De la verdad de la implicación y del hecho de que P es falsa, **no podemos deducir nada sobre Q**.  
Así que no hay suficiente información para afirmar si hay un inflador en el garatge.

Enunciat de la Maria: **P → Q**  

Sabem del context:  
- La planta està seca (P és vertadera).  
- No hi ha cap mànega al jardí (això no afecta directament Q).  
- No se’ns diu directament si Q és certa o falsa, només que la Maria ha dit P → Q.

1. Sabem que **la planta no està seca**.

La Maria diu:  

> ""Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari.""

Això és una condicional:  
- **P**: La camisa del Jordi està arrugada.  
- **Q**: Hi ha una planxa a l'armari.  

En lògica, ""Si P, aleshores Q"" només és falsa quan P és certa i Q és falsa. En tots els altres casos, la frase pot ser certa (però no diu que P sigui certa ni que Q ho sigui per força).  

El context diu:  
- La camisa del Jordi està arrugada (P és cert).  
- Hi ha una planxa a l'armari (Q és cert).  

Com que P és cert i Q és cert, la condicional ""Si P, aleshores Q"" és **veritable**. Per tant, el que diu la Maria és veritat.  

La pregunta és: **És veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?**  

La Maria no afirma directament ""hi ha una planxa a l'armari"", només afirma la condicional. Però, independentment del que digui la Maria, el context ens diu explícitament que hi ha una planxa a l'armari.  

Per tant, la resposta és:

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?","Vamos a analizar la frase de la Maria paso a paso.  

**Enunciado:**  
- La camisa del Jordi està arrugada.  
- No hi ha cap planxa a l'armari.  
- No hi ha cap taula de planxar al balcó.  
- Maria diu: ""Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari"".  

---

**1. Identificar p y q**  
- \( p \): La camisa del Jordi està arrugada → **Verdad** (según el contexto).  
- \( q \): Hi ha una planxa a l'armari → **Falso** (según el contexto: ""no hi ha cap planxa a l'armari"").  

---

**2. La frase de Maria**  
Maria dice: \( p \rightarrow q \)  
""Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, llavors hi ha una planxa a l'armari"".  

En lògica, \( p \rightarrow q \) es falsa solo si \( p \) es verdad y \( q \) es falso.  

---

**3. Evaluar**  
- \( p \) = Verdad  
- \( q \) = Falso  
- \( p \rightarrow q \) = Falso  

Por lo tanto, la frase de Maria es **falsa** en esta situación.

---

**1. Contexto:**

- La camisa del Jordi no té arrugues.
- Hi ha una taula de planxar al balcó.
- Maria diu: ""Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari.""

---

**2. Formalización:**

- \( P \): La camisa del Jordi està arrugada.
- \( Q \): Hi ha una planxa a l'armari.

Maria dice:  
\[

---

**3. Informació sobre \( P \):**

Sabem que la camisa **no** té arrugues, és a dir:  
\[
\neg P \quad \text{(P és fals)}
\]

---

**4. Lógica de la implicació \( P \rightarrow Q \):**

La taula de veritat de \( P \rightarrow Q \) és:

- Si \( P \) és fals, \( P \rightarrow Q \) és **veritat** sigui \( Q \) cert o fals.

Per tant, si \( P \) és fals, la frase de Maria és **true** sense importar \( Q \).

---

**5. Podem saber si \( Q \) és certa?**

No. Perquè \( P \rightarrow Q \) només seria fals si \( P \) és cert i \( Q \) és fals.  
Com que \( P \) és fals, la implicació és certa, però no ens diu res sobre el valor de \( Q \).

---

**6. Conclusió:**

No podem assegurar que hi hagi una planxa a l'armari. Només sabem que la condició ""si camisa arrugada → planxa a l'armari"" és certa, però com que la camisa no està arrugada, la implicació no obliga a \( Q \) a ser certa.

3. Pel context, \( P \) és certa (la Susanna vol llegir).  
4. Si \( P \) és certa i \( P \rightarrow Q \) és certa (suposant que la Maria diu la veritat), aleshores \( Q \) ha de ser certa.  

Però cal notar: el context també diu explícitament *""no hi ha llibres a l'estanteria""* i *""tampoc no hi ha cap diari al sofà""*.  
Això vol dir que, en realitat (en el món del context), \( Q \) és falsa.

El context dóna dues dades clau:

1.  **""Tot i que la pizza és més cara que la pasta, la gent la compra més.""** Això indica directament que, malgrat el major cost (que normalment seria un desavantatge), la pizza té una major demanda o és més adquirida que la pasta. Aquesta és una forta evidència de la seva popularitat.

2.  **""Hi ha pizza a la nevera.""** Aquest detall anecdòctic reforça la idea que la pizza és un producte comú i present a la llar, cosa que coincideix amb la seva popularitat.

**1. Traducir las afirmaciones a lógica proposicional:**

- \( P \): El lloro está en la jaula (gàbia).  
- \( Q \): El perro está en la perrera (gossera).  
- \( R \): Tomás lleva pizza.

Del texto:

1. ""El lloro no és a la gàbia"" → \( \neg P \)  
2. ""El gos tampoc no és a la gossera"" → \( \neg Q \)  
3. ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza"" → \( P \to R \)

En lógica, una implicación ""Si P, entonces Q"" solo es falsa si P es verdadero y Q es falso. Si P es falso, la implicación es verdadera (no se incumple) sin importar Q.  

En tu caso:  
- Dices: ""T'has acabat els bròquils"" → P es verdadero.  
- Entonces, para que la frase de la María sea cierta, debe cumplirse Q: que el Marc et doni un caramel.

3. La implicación **solo es falsa si Pau corta la gespa y no recibe los 50 euros**.  
   Si Pau no cortó la gespa, la implicación es verdadera (no importa si recibe o no los 50 euros).

4. Como no sabemos si Pau fue quien cortó la gespa, no podemos concluir con certeza que **Pau ha recibido 50 euros**.  
   Podría ser que otra persona cortó la gespa, y en ese caso Pau no tiene por qué recibir nada (según la frase de Maria).

**Conclusión:**  
No podemos afirmar que sea veritat que Pau ha rebut 50 euros, porque no hay evidencia de que Pau haya sido quien cortó la gespa.

**Respuesta:**  
No, no es veritat que necessàriament el Pau hagi rebut 50 euros."
S7F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. El Pau no ha rebut 50 euros. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","Vamos a analizar la información paso a paso.

1. **Premisas:**
   - La gespa ha estat tallada.
   - Les flors també han estat regades.
   - El Pau **no** ha rebut 50 euros.
   - Maria va dir: *""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros""* (Si P, aleshores Q, on P = ""Pau talla la gespa"", Q = ""Pau rep 50 euros"").

2. **Anàlisi lògica:**
   - Maria va dir: \( P \rightarrow Q \)
   - Sabem que la gespa ha estat tallada, però no ens diuen qui la va tallar. Però la frase de Maria només lliga que **si Pau la talla**, aleshores rep els 50 euros. No diu que ningú més no pugui tallar-la.

3. **Dades importants:**
   - Sabem que **Pau no ha rebut 50 euros** (¬Q).
   - Per a que la promessa de Maria sigui veritable, si ¬Q, aleshores ¬P (per contraposició: \( P \rightarrow Q \) és equivalent a \( \neg Q \rightarrow \neg P \)).
   - Per tant, si no ha rebut els 50 euros, vol dir que **Pau no ha tallat la gespa** (¬P).

4. **Conclusió:**
   - La gespa va ser tallada (algú ho va fer), però no va ser en Pau (perquè si hagués estat en Pau, hauria rebut els 50 euros, i sabem que no els ha rebut).
   - La pregunta: *""És veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?""* → **No**, és fals, perquè se'ns diu directament que no ha rebut els 50 euros.

**Resposta:** No, no és veritat. El Pau no ha rebut 50 euros."
S7C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa no ha estat tallada. Les flors tampoc no han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","Analitzem les dades:

1. **""La gespa no ha estat tallada.""** → És un fet.
2. **""Les flors tampoc no han estat regades.""** → No rellevant directament per al pagament.
3. **La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros.""** → Aquesta és una condicional:  
   ""Si P, aleshores Q"", on  
   P = ""Pau talla la gespa""  
   Q = ""Pau rep 50 euros"".

Com que sabem que la gespa **no** ha estat tallada, P és falsa.

En lògica, quan l’antecedent (P) d’una condicional és fals, la condicional és **veritable** independentment de si Q és cert o fals. Però això **no vol dir que Q sigui cert**. Només vol dir que la promesa de la Maria no s’ha trencat.

Per tant, de ""P és fals"" no podem deduir que Q sigui cert. De fet, el sentit comú diu que si no ha tallat la gespa, no rep els 50 euros.

**Resposta:** No, no és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros.

1. **Premises**:
   - El gos està jugant. (Això és un fet, segons el context.)
   - La Maria va dir: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre.""

2. **Estructura lògica**:
   - P: ""El gos està jugant"" → **Cert** (donat en el context).
   - Q: ""L'Antoni llegirà un llibre.""
   - La Maria va afirmar: P → Q.

3. **Aplicació de les regles**:
   - Sabem que P → Q és una afirmació que ha fet la Maria.
   - Sabem que P és cert.
   - Si P és cert i P → Q és cert, aleshores Q ha de ser cert.

4. **Problema**: No se'ns diu explícitament si la frase de la Maria és **veritable** en la realitat, només que ella ho va dir.  
   - Si suposem que la Maria diu la veritat, aleshores sí, Q és cert.
   - Però si no sabem si la Maria diu la veritat, no podem assegurar Q.

Com que la pregunta diu ""Segons el que diu la Maria"", sembla que el que ens interessa és la conclusió lògica **dins del marc de les seves afirmacions i dels fets donats**, assumint que ella diu la veritat.

---

**Anàlisi lògica:**
- La frase de Maria és: \( P \rightarrow Q \).
- Sabem que \( P \) és fals (per la premissa 1: el gos no està jugant).
- En lògica, quan el antecedent \( P \) és fals, la implicació \( P \rightarrow Q \) és **veritable** sigui quin sigui \( Q \) (taula de veritat de la implicació).
- Per tant, el fet que la frase de Maria sigui veritable (no hi ha contradicció amb les premisses) no ens diu res sobre si \( Q \) és veritat o no. Només sabem que \( P \rightarrow Q \) és certa perquè \( P \) és fals.

---

**Respecte a si és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre:**
- No tenim cap dada que permeti afirmar \( Q \) (és a dir, que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre).
- Tampoc tenim cap dada que permeti afirmar \( \neg Q \) (que no ho ha fet).
- Per tant, **no podem determinar** si l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre només amb la informació donada.

S9T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La nevera està buida. A més, el forn està espatllat. La Maria havia dit: ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Anna ha portat donuts?","Analitzem l’enunciat pas a pas.  

1. Sabem que:  
   - La nevera està buida.  
   - El forn està espatllat (aquesta dada no influeix directament en la condicional de la Maria).  

2. La Maria va dir:  
   > ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts.""  

   És una implicació lògica:  
   \[
   P \rightarrow Q
   \]
   on \(P\) = ""la nevera està buida"", \(Q\) = ""l'Anna portarà donuts"".  

3. Sabem que \(P\) és veritat (nevera buida).  
   Per a \(P \rightarrow Q\), si \(P\) és cert, aleshores \(Q\) ha de ser cert perquè la implicació sigui veritat.  

4. Però cal distingir:  
   - La Maria va **afirmar** \(P \rightarrow Q\).  
   - No se'ns diu si el que va dir la Maria és veritat o no.  
   - Si suposem que la Maria diu la veritat, aleshores com \(P\) és cert, \(Q\) ha de ser cert (Anna porta donuts).  
   - Si no suposem que la Maria diu la veritat, només amb \(P\) cert no podem assegurar \(Q\).  

Com la pregunta diu ""Segons el que diu la Maria"", sembla que estem dins del món on la Maria diu la veritat.

4. La Maria va dir: ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts"" (condicional: \( P \rightarrow Q \), on \(P\) = ""nevera buida"", \(Q\) = ""Anna porta donuts"").  

Com que la nevera està buida (\(P\) és cert), per la frase de la Maria, hauria de passar que l'Anna porti donuts (\(Q\) sigui cert).  
Però el context diu que l'Anna **no** ha portat donuts (\(Q\) és fals).  

Això vol dir que la predicció de la Maria **no s'ha complert**. Per tant, la frase de la Maria **no és veritat** (és falsa) en aquesta situació.

B4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. C'è anche un computer sul tavolo.

Questa è un'implicazione logica:  
**Se P allora Q**, dove  
- P = ""il telefono di Pietro è scarico"" (Vero, dal contesto)  
- Q = ""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto""  

Dal contesto sappiamo che P è vero.  
L'implicazione ""Se P allora Q"" è vera in tutti i casi tranne quando P è vero e Q è falso.  

Ma qui non sappiamo se l'affermazione di Maria sia vera o falsa — il contesto ci dà solo che P è vero, e che Maria ha detto ""Se P allora Q"".  

Se Maria dice il vero, allora dato che P è vero, Q deve essere vero.  
Ma il problema non ci dice che Maria dice il vero, quindi non possiamo concludere con certezza che Q sia vero.  

Tuttavia, il contesto aggiunge: ""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"" come dato di fatto (prima frase). Quindi, indipendentemente da quello che dice Maria, il caricatore c'è.  

Ma la domanda è: **In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?**  

Se Maria dice ""Se P allora Q"" e noi sappiamo che P è vero, per sapere se Q è vero dobbiamo sapere se l'implicazione di Maria è vera. Ma non lo sappiamo. Quindi, **solo in base a quello che dice Maria**, non possiamo dedurre che Q sia vero, a meno di supporre che Maria dica il vero (ma il problema non lo specifica).  

Ma il contesto iniziale dice già che il caricatore c'è, quindi in realtà la risposta è sì, c'è, ma non per quello che dice Maria — piuttosto per il contesto dato.  

Se rispettiamo la richiesta ""In base a quello che dice Maria"", senza usare il fatto che il caricatore c'è (che è fuori dalla sua affermazione), allora:  
- Maria ha detto: Se P allora Q.  
- Sappiamo P vero.  
- Se Maria dice il vero → Q è vero.  
- Se Maria non dice il vero → non possiamo concludere nulla su Q.  

Dato che il problema non dice che Maria dice il vero, non possiamo dedurlo solo dalla sua affermazione.  

Ma qui il contesto iniziale è dato come fatto, quindi il caricatore c'è.  

**Risposta:** Sì, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto, ma non perché lo si deduce da quello che dice Maria, bensì perché è un fatto del contesto.  

Se la domanda vuole solo la deduzione dall'affermazione di Maria, allora non si può essere sicuri. Ma visto che il contesto dice che c'è, la risposta è:  

**Sì, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto.**"
B4F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. Non c'è nemmeno un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","Analizziamo la situazione.

**Fatti noti:**
1. Il telefono di Pietro è scarico.
2. Non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto.
3. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"".

La frase di Maria è un condizionale:  
\[
\text{Se } P \text{ allora } Q
\]
dove  
\(P\) = ""il telefono di Pietro è scarico"" (Vero)  
\(Q\) = ""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"" (Falso, secondo i fatti noti).

Quindi abbiamo:
\[
P \quad \text{è VERO}
\]
\[
Q \quad \text{è FALSO}
\]
\[
\text{Maria dice: } P \rightarrow Q
\]

Ma \(P \rightarrow Q\) è falso quando \(P\) è vero e \(Q\) è falso.  
Quindi l'affermazione di Maria è **falsa** rispetto alla situazione reale.

Tuttavia, la domanda chiede:  
> È vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?

Dai fatti noti, sappiamo che **non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto**.  
Quindi la risposta è: **No, non è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto**.

**Risposta:** No."
B4C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è carico. C'è un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","Analizziamo la situazione.

**Premesse:**
1. Il telefono di Pietro è carico (fatto noto).
2. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto.""

La frase di Maria è un’implicazione logica:  
\[
\text{Telefono scarico} \rightarrow \text{Caricatore nel cassetto}
\]

Sappiamo che l’antecedente (""telefono scarico"") è **falso** (perché il telefono è carico).  
In logica, quando l’antecedente è falso, l’implicazione è **vera** indipendentemente dal valore di verità del conseguente (""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"").

Quindi, dalla verità dell’affermazione di Maria **non possiamo dedurre** se ci sia o meno un caricatore nel cassetto.  

**Risposta:** Non si può concludere che sia vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto."
B5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. C'è anche un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","Analizziamo la situazione.  

Maria dice:  
> ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.""

Sappiamo dal contesto che:  
- Il tempo **è** piovoso.  
- C'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli (fatto osservato).  

La frase di Maria è un’implicazione logica:  
**Piove → Ombrello presente**  

Dato che **Piove = Vero** e **Ombrello presente = Vero**, l’implicazione è vera.  

La domanda però chiede:  
> È vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?  

La risposta non dipende solo dalla verità dell’implicazione, ma anche dal fatto osservato nel contesto: il testo dice esplicitamente che c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.  

Quindi:  

**Sì, è vero che c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.**"
B5F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. Non c'è nemmeno un impermeabile in macchina.

---

**1. Contesto dato:**
- Il tempo è piovoso.
- Non c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.
- Non c’è un impermeabile in macchina.

**2. Affermazione di Maria:**
> ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.""

In logica formale:  
\[
P = \text{""Il tempo è piovoso""} \quad Q = \text{""C'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli""}
\]  
Maria dice: \( P \rightarrow Q \).

---

**3. Valori di verità nel contesto:**
- \( P \) è **vero** (il tempo è piovoso).
- \( Q \) è **falso** (non c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli).

---

**4. Verità dell’implicazione \( P \rightarrow Q \):**
Un’implicazione \( P \rightarrow Q \) è falsa **solo se** \( P \) è vero e \( Q \) è falso.  
Qui abbiamo proprio \( P \) vero e \( Q \) falso, quindi \( P \rightarrow Q \) è **falsa**.

---

**5. Cosa significa?**
Maria ha detto una frase falsa, perché nella realtà, pur essendo piovoso, non c’è ombrello.  
Ma la domanda non chiede se Maria dice il vero, bensì:  
> ""È vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?""

Dai dati del contesto, sappiamo che **non c’è** ombrello nel portaombrelli, quindi la risposta è **no**.

**6. Risposta finale:**

B5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è sereno. C'è un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","Analizziamo il testo.

**Contesto:**
- Il tempo è sereno.
- C'è un impermeabile in macchina.
- Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"".

La frase di Maria è un condizionale:  
**Se Piove → C'è l'ombrello nel portaombrelli**  
(P → Q)

Ora, sappiamo che **P è falso** (il tempo è sereno, non piove).  

In logica, se P è falso, l'implicazione P → Q è **sempre vera**, indipendentemente dal valore di Q.  
Quindi, la frase di Maria è logicamente vera in questa situazione, ma non ci dà informazioni su Q (se c'è l'ombrello) quando P è falso.

Dunque, **non possiamo dedurre** se c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli o meno, basandoci solo sulle informazioni date.

**Risposta:** Non si può stabilire se c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli."
B6T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e c'è una pompa in garage. C'è anche una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso.

**Contesto:**
- La gomma della macchina è a terra.
- C'è una pompa in garage.
- C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso.
- Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"".

**Logica:**
Maria ha fatto un'affermazione condizionale:  
**Se P allora Q**, dove:  
P = ""la gomma della macchina è a terra""  
Q = ""c'è una pompa in garage""

Dal contesto sappiamo che **P è vera** (la gomma è a terra) e **Q è vera** (c'è una pompa in garage).  
L'affermazione di Maria è: P → Q.  
Se P è vera e Q è vera, allora P → Q è vera.  
Quindi Maria dice il vero.

**La domanda:** ""È vero che c'è una pompa in garage?""  
La risposta dipende dai fatti del contesto, non dalla verità dell'affermazione di Maria.  
Il contesto dice chiaramente: ""c'è una pompa in garage"".  
Quindi la risposta è **sì**.

**Contesto dato:**
1. La gomma della macchina è a terra.
2. Non c'è nessuna pompa in garage.
3. Non c'è nemmeno una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso.

**Dichiarazione di Maria:**
""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage.""

In logica, questa è un'implicazione:

Maria afferma: \( P \rightarrow Q \).

Dal contesto sappiamo che \( P \) è vera (la gomma è a terra) e \( Q \) è falsa (non c'è pompa in garage).

Ma la domanda non è se l'affermazione di Maria è vera, bensì:

Dal contesto, sappiamo già che **non c'è una pompa in garage**, quindi la risposta è **no**.

**Risposta:** No."

**Fatti noti:**
1. La gomma della macchina è gonfia (non a terra, quindi non completamente sgonfia).
2. C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso.
3. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"".

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione logica:  
**Se** (gomma a terra) **allora** (pompa in garage).

Ora, la gomma *non* è a terra (è solo gonfia), quindi la condizione ""gomma a terra"" è falsa.  
In logica, quando l'antecedente è falso, l'implicazione è vera indipendentemente dal conseguente.

La parola **""li""** si riferisce a **""cani""** (il complemento oggetto ""li"" = ""loro"" si riferisce a ciò di cui si è parlato prima, e l'ultimo soggetto maschile plurale è ""cani"").  
Quindi il senso è: sebbene i cani siano più vivaci, le persone preferiscono i cani (non i gatti).

S3T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Le volpi stanno ballando. Inoltre, gli scoiattoli stanno mangiando. Maria aveva detto: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica"".

**Fatti noti:**
1. Le volpi stanno ballando.  
2. Maria ha detto: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica"".

La frase di Maria è un condizionale:  
**Volpi ballano → Susanna riceve macchina fotografica.**

Sappiamo che le volpi ballano (dal contesto).  
Se l’affermazione di Maria è vera, allora, per modus ponens, Susanna riceverà la macchina fotografica.

Ma dobbiamo verificare se l’affermazione di Maria è vera.  
Nel contesto non c’è nulla che dica che Maria stia mentendo o che l’affermazione sia falsa. In logica, se prendiamo per vero ciò che Maria dice, allora la conclusione segue.

Tuttavia, il problema chiede: *È vero che Susanna ha ricevuto una macchina fotografica?*  
Noi sappiamo solo che Maria ha detto che la riceverà se le volpi ballano. Ma non sappiamo se Maria dice il vero, a meno di non assumere che tutto ciò che dice Maria sia vero.  
Se invece prendiamo il contesto come descrittivo di fatti reali, allora le volpi ballano, e Maria ha detto quella frase, ma non sappiamo se la frase di Maria corrisponde a realtà.

**Tuttavia**, in molti problemi di logica, se non ci viene detto che Maria mente, e ci viene dato un fatto (volpi ballano) e un condizionale (dichiarato da Maria), e ci viene chiesto di trarre una conclusione *basandoci su quello che dice Maria*, allora si assume che l’implicazione sia vera.

Quindi:  
- Premessa 1: Volpi ballano (fatto del contesto)  
- Premessa 2: Se volpi ballano → Susanna riceve macchina fotografica (da Maria, e assumiamo vero)

1. La TV è accesa.

4. Maria aveva detto: ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"".

La frase di Maria è un condizionale:  
\[

Dai fatti 1 e 3:  
- TV accesa è VERA  
- Matteo prepara i biscotti è FALSO  

Quindi abbiamo:
\[
V \rightarrow F
\]
che è FALSO in logica.  

Ma qui il problema chiede: *In base a quello che dice Maria* — cioè assumendo che l’affermazione di Maria sia vera — dobbiamo dedurre se Matteo ha preparato i biscotti.

Se Maria dice il vero, allora il condizionale \( TV\ accesa \rightarrow Matteo\ prepara\ i\ biscotti \) dev’essere vero.  
Ma se la TV è accesa (vero) e il condizionale è vero, allora “Matteo prepara i biscotti” dev’essere vero.  

Tuttavia, il fatto 3 dice che Matteo **non** ha preparato i biscotti.  
Quindi c’è una contraddizione tra i fatti e l’ipotesi che Maria dica il vero.  

Ma la domanda è: **In base a quello che dice Maria** — quindi assumendo che l’affermazione di Maria sia vera — si può concludere che Matteo ha preparato i biscotti?  
Sì, perché:  
- TV accesa = Vero  
- Se \( V \rightarrow X \) è vero, allora \( X \) dev’essere vero.  
Quindi Matteo ha preparato i biscotti.  

Ma il fatto 3 dice che non li ha preparati, quindi in realtà Maria sta mentendo.  
Tuttavia, la domanda chiede di basarsi solo su ciò che Maria dice (cioè assumendo che sia vera) e sui fatti del mondo che sono indipendenti (TV accesa).  

**Risposta:**  
Se Maria dice il vero, allora Matteo ha preparato i biscotti.  
Ma nel mondo reale (dai fatti) non li ha preparati → Maria non dice il vero.  

La domanda: ""È vero che Matteo ha preparato i biscotti?""  
- Secondo i fatti no.  
- Secondo l’implicazione di Maria (se vera) sì.

Tuttavia, se la domanda vuole solo la deduzione dall’affermazione di Maria (presumendola vera) e dal fatto che la TV è accesa, allora la risposta sarebbe **Sì**.

**1. Interpretazione logica**  
L’affermazione di Maria:

**2. Verifica della verità di \( A \rightarrow B \)**  
Una implicazione \( A \rightarrow B \) è falsa solo se \( A \) è vera e \( B \) è falsa.  
Qui \( A \) è falsa (TV spenta), quindi \( A \rightarrow B \) è **vera** indipendentemente dal valore di \( B \).  
Dunque l’affermazione di Maria è **vera** in questa situazione, ma questo non ci dice se \( B \) è vera o falsa.

**1. Traduciamo le affermazioni in logica proposizionale**

- \( P \): Il parco giochi è vuoto.  
- \( Q \): Le strade sono tranquille.  
- \( S \): Angela si è fatta un selfie.

---

**2. Informazioni date**

1. \( P \) è vero (il parco giochi è vuoto).  
2. \( Q \) è vero (le strade sono tranquille).  
3. \( \text{Non } S \) (Angela non si è fatta un selfie).  
4. Maria ha detto: ""Se \( P \), allora \( S \)"" ovvero \( P \to S \).

---

**3. Verifica della veridicità di \( S \)**

- \( P \to S \) è un’affermazione fatta da Maria.  
- Non ci viene detto se Maria dice la verità o il falso.  
- Sappiamo però che \( P \) è vero e \( S \) è falso (dai fatti 1 e 3).  
- Quindi \( P \to S \) è: Vero → Falso = Falso.  
- Quindi Maria ha detto una frase falsa.

3. **Regola logica**:  
   Se \( P \) è falso, l'implicazione \( P \to Q \) è **vera** indipendentemente dal valore di \( Q \).  
   Questo significa che l'affermazione di Maria non ci dà informazioni su \( Q \) quando \( P \) è falso.

1. **Fatti noti**:
   - Il prato è stato tagliato.
   - I fiori sono stati annaffiati.

2. **Condizione di Maria**:
   - La frase è un'implicazione logica:  
     **Se P allora Q**, dove  
     P = ""Paolo taglia il prato""  
     Q = ""Paolo riceve 50 euro"".

3. **Informazione sul prato**:
   - Sappiamo che il prato è stato tagliato, ma **non sappiamo chi l'ha tagliato**.
   - Potrebbe averlo tagliato Paolo, oppure un'altra persona.

4. **Logica**:
   - Se fosse stato Paolo a tagliare il prato (P vero), allora per l'affermazione di Maria, Q dovrebbe essere vero (Paolo riceve 50 euro).
   - Tuttavia, se il prato è stato tagliato da qualcun altro (P falso), l'implicazione ""Se P allora Q"" è **vera indipendentemente da Q** (per la tabella di verità dell'implicazione: falso → qualsiasi cosa è vero). Quindi non possiamo dedurre se Q è vero o falso.

5. **Conclusione**:
   - Dato che non è specificato che Paolo ha tagliato il prato, **non possiamo concludere con certezza che Paolo abbia ricevuto 50 euro**.

**Risposta**: No, non è necessariamente vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro, perché non sappiamo se è stato Paolo a tagliare il prato."

María dice:  
> ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno.""

Esto es una implicación lógica:  
\[

\]

Sabemos del contexto que:  
1. **Juan tiene hambre** (es verdadero).  
2. **Hay pizza en el horno** (también es verdadero según el contexto).

Como el antecedente (""Juan tiene hambre"") es verdadero y el consecuente (""hay pizza en el horno"") es verdadero, la implicación es verdadera.  
Pero la pregunta no es si lo que dice María es verdadero, sino si **es verdad que hay pizza en el horno**.

El enunciado de María no afirma directamente ""hay pizza en el horno"", sino que lo afirma bajo la condición de que Juan tenga hambre.  
Sin embargo, en el contexto dado, sabemos independientemente que hay pizza en el horno.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta es:

**Sí, es verdad que hay pizza en el horno**, pero no porque María lo diga en una condicional, sino porque el contexto lo afirma directamente."

- En lógica, de \( P \) y \( P \to Q \) se deduce \( Q \) (Modus Ponens).  
- Pero aquí no sabemos si \( P \to Q \) es verdad, solo que María lo dice.  
- Si María miente, \( P \to Q \) podría ser falso, y en ese caso \( P \) verdad y \( Q \) falso es posible.  
- Además, el enunciado no nos dice si María siempre dice la verdad.

**4. Información adicional relevante:**
- Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería, pero eso no contradice que haya agua en la nevera.  
- El hecho de que haya zumo no nos da información directa sobre el agua.

---

**5. Conclusión:**
Como no podemos verificar la verdad de lo que dice María (la condicional) a partir de los hechos dados, **no podemos concluir con certeza que haya agua en la nevera**.

---

**Respuesta final:**  
No necesariamente; no se puede determinar con la información dada.

B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","Vamos a analizar la lógica del enunciado.  

María dice:  

> Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón.  

Esto es una implicación lógica:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]
donde:  
- \( P \): ""El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería""  
- \( Q \): ""Hay un cargador en el cajón""  

Sabemos por el contexto que **P es verdadero** (el móvil de Pedro sí se quedó sin batería).  

Para que \( P \rightarrow Q \) sea verdad, si \( P \) es verdad, entonces \( Q \) debe ser verdad.  
Pero el problema no nos dice si lo que dice María es verdad o no; solo sabemos que ella lo dice.  

Sin embargo, el contexto añade:  

> El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón.  

Esto nos dice que \( P \) es verdad y \( Q \) es verdad.  

Por lo tanto, **sí es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón**, no por lo que dice María, sino porque el contexto lo afirma directamente.  

**Respuesta:** Sí, es verdad."

Sabemos del contexto:  
- **El tiempo está lluvioso** (llueve = verdadero).  
- **Hay un paraguas en el paragüero** (también es un hecho del contexto).  

La afirmación de María es una implicación:

1. **Contexto dado**:
   - El tiempo está lluvioso.

   - No hay chubasquero en el coche.

2. **Declaración de María**:
   - ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"".

1. **Premisas**:
   - El tiempo está despejado (no lluvioso).
   - Hay un chubasquero en el coche (esto no afecta directamente a la implicación sobre el paraguas).
   - María dice: *""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero""*.  
     Esto es una implicación lógica: \( Lluvioso \rightarrow ParaguasEnParagüero \).

2. **Situación actual**:
   - Sabemos que \( Lluvioso \) es falso (porque el tiempo está despejado).

3. **Regla lógica**:
   - En lógica, \( P \rightarrow Q \) es verdadera cuando \( P \) es falso, sin importar el valor de \( Q \).  
     Es decir, si no llueve, la afirmación de María es **verdadera** independientemente de si hay o no paraguas en el paragüero.

4. **Conclusión**:
   - La frase de María no afirma nada sobre la situación cuando no llueve.  
     Por lo tanto, **no podemos deducir** si hay un paraguas en el paragüero o no.

**4. Evaluación de \(P \rightarrow Q\) cuando \(P\) es falso**

En lógica, una implicación \(P \rightarrow Q\) es verdadera si \(P\) es falso, sin importar el valor de \(Q\).  
Es decir:  
\[

","En el contexto que das, se dice que **""Aunque la pizza sea más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más""**. Esto indica que, a pesar de ser más cara, la pizza se vende/comprar más que la pasta.  
Además, se menciona que **""Hay pizza en la nevera""**, lo que refuerza la idea de que la pizza está presente y se consume.  

Por lo tanto, **la pasta no es más popular que la pizza**; de hecho, la pizza es más comprada (y por tanto, al menos en términos de ventas, más popular).  

**Respuesta:** No, la pasta no es más popular que la pizza."
F2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera. En este contexto, ¿se utiliza más el té verde que el café negro?","En el contexto proporcionado, se dice: ""Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde"". Esto indica que, efectivamente, el té verde se utiliza más que el café negro porque es la bebida preferida por la mayoría.

**Respuesta:** Sí, se utiliza más el té verde que el café negro."
F2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera. En este contexto, ¿se utiliza más el café negro que el té verde?","En el contexto proporcionado:

- Aunque el café negro es más barato, la mayoría prefiere el té verde.
- Hay café negro en la cafetera, pero no se menciona nada sobre el té verde.

La pregunta es si se **utiliza más** el café negro que el té verde. El hecho de que esté disponible (en la cafetera) no significa que se use más, especialmente cuando se dice explícitamente que la mayoría prefiere el té verde.  

**Respuesta: No**, no se utiliza más el café negro; la mayoría prefiere y probablemente usa más el té verde."
F3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿los refrescos tienen más demanda que el agua?","Vamos a analizar el contexto dado:  

1. Se dice que, aunque el agua es más saludable, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos.  
2. Luego se menciona “Hay agua en el ordenador”, lo cual parece una frase fuera de lugar o posiblemente un error (podría ser “Hay agua en el mercado” o algo similar, pero tal vez es una expresión idiomática o un error tipográfico).  

La pregunta es: **¿Los refrescos tienen más demanda que el agua?**  

Del contexto, la clave es “mucha gente prefiere los refrescos”. Si hay preferencia por los refrescos sobre el agua, eso sugiere que la demanda de refrescos podría ser mayor, al menos en el grupo de personas al que se refiere el texto.  

Sin embargo, la frase “Hay agua en el ordenador” no aporta información relevante sobre la demanda, por lo que la respuesta se basa en la primera oración.  

**Respuesta:** Sí, porque mucha gente prefiere los refrescos aunque el agua sea más saludable."
F3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿el agua tiene más demanda que los refrescos?","En el contexto dado, la oración ""Hay agua en el ordenador"" no tiene sentido lógico y parece fuera de lugar o posiblemente un error.  
La primera parte dice que mucha gente prefiere los refrescos aunque el agua sea más saludable.  

Por lo tanto, la respuesta a si el agua tiene más demanda que los refrescos, basándonos en el contexto, es:  

**No, el agua no tiene más demanda que los refrescos, porque mucha gente prefiere los refrescos.**"
F4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más. Hay brócoli en el horno. En este contexto, ¿el brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis?","Vamos a analizar el contexto paso a paso.  

El texto dice:  

> Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más.  

Esto significa que, a pesar de la dificultad, el brócoli se consume más que los ñoquis.  

Luego dice:  

> Hay brócoli en el horno.  

Esto es un dato adicional sobre una situación concreta, pero no cambia la comparación general.  

La pregunta es:  

> ¿El brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis?  

Si ""más popular"" se entiende como ""más consumido"" o ""más comúnmente comido"", entonces la primera oración nos da la respuesta: **sí, la gente lo come más**.  

**Respuesta:** Sí, el brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis."
F4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más. Hay brócoli en el horno. En este contexto, ¿los ñoquis son más populare que el brócoli?","No, según el contexto proporcionado:

- Aunque el brócoli es más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, **la gente lo come más**.

Luego se agrega: ""Hay sushi en la mesa"".

La clave es que se dice explícitamente que la gente come hamburguesas **con más frecuencia**, lo que indica que las hamburguesas son más populares en términos de consumo habitual, a pesar de que el sushi sea más saludable. El hecho de que haya sushi en la mesa en un momento particular no contradice la afirmación general sobre la frecuencia de consumo.

**Respuesta: No, el sushi no es más popular que las hamburguesas.**"

- Hay plátanos en la cesta.

La afirmación ""los plátanos son más caros que los kiwis"" no se puede confirmar, pero la pregunta es si los plátanos son más caros que los kiwis. Dado que la oración original dice ""los plátanos son más caros que los kiwis"", la respuesta es:

Sí, los plátanos son más caros que los kiwis."
F6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más. Hay plátanos en la cesta. En este contexto, ¿los kiwis son más populares que los platanos?","Vamos a analizar la información paso a paso.  

1. El contexto dice: *Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más*.  
   - Esto significa que, a pesar de un precio mayor, los plátanos tienen mayor demanda o volumen de compra que los kiwis.  

2. La pregunta es: *¿Los kiwis son más populares que los plátanos?*  
   - ""Popular"" en este contexto se interpreta como ""más comprado"" o ""más demandado"".  

3. Dado que la gente compra **más** plátanos que kiwis, los plátanos son más populares.  

Por lo tanto, la respuesta es:  

**No, los kiwis no son más populares que los plátanos.**"

En este contexto, ¿los perros son más populares que los gatos?","En el contexto proporcionado, se dice que ""aunque los perros sean más vivaces que los gatos, la gente los prefiere"" (refiriéndose a los perros). Esto indica que, en esta situación específica, la gente prefiere a los perros. Por lo tanto, **sí, los perros son más populares que los gatos** en este contexto."
F7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los perros sean más vivaces que los gatos, la gente los prefiere. Hay un gato en lo alto del árbol. En este contexto, ¿los gatos son más populares que los perros?","Vamos a analizar el contexto.  

La frase dice:  

> Aunque los perros sean más vivaces que los gatos, la gente los prefiere.  

Aquí “los” (en “la gente los prefiere”) se refiere a **perros**, porque es el sujeto de la primera parte de la comparación (“Aunque los perros sean más vivaces…”).  
Significa: aunque los perros son más vivaces, la gente prefiere a los perros (no a los gatos).  

La segunda oración (“Hay un gato en lo alto del árbol”) no cambia la preferencia general mencionada en la primera oración.  

Por lo tanto, **los perros son preferidos**, no los gatos.  

**Respuesta:** No, los gatos no son más populares que los perros.

En este contexto, ¿más personas ven la televisión de las que leen libros? ","En el contexto dado, se dice: ""Aunque leer libros sea más educativo que ver la televisión, mucha gente ve la televisión"". Esto implica que hay una comparación donde, a pesar del valor educativo de la lectura, la televisión tiene una audiencia masiva. La oración ""Hay un libro en la estantería"" no modifica esta relación.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta es:  
**Sí, más personas ven la televisión que las que leen libros.**"
F8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque leer libros sea más educativo que ver la televisión, mucha gente ve la televisión. Hay un libro en la estantería. En este contexto, ¿más personas ven la televisión de las que leen libros?

Esto implica que, aunque leer libros es más educativo, mucha gente ve la televisión. Además, se menciona que ""Hay un libro en la estantería"", pero esto no proporciona información sobre el número de personas que leen libros.

La frase ""mucha gente ve la televisión"" sugiere que la cantidad de personas que ven televisión es grande. Aunque no se da un número concreto de personas que leen libros, la estructura de la oración contrasta la actividad educativa (leer libros) con la actividad más popular (ver televisión). Por lo tanto, la implicación es que más personas ven la televisión que leen libros.

1. **Premisas**  
   - El loro está en la jaula.  
   - El perro está en la caseta.  
   - María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza».  

2. **Condicional de María**  
   María dijo:  
   \[
   P \rightarrow Q
   \]
   donde:  
   \(P\): «El loro está en la jaula» → **Verdadero** (según el contexto).  
   \(Q\): «Tomás traerá pizza».  

3. **Evaluación del condicional**  
   \(P\) es verdadero.  
   Para que \(P \rightarrow Q\) sea verdadero (María dijo la verdad), dado \(P\) verdadero, \(Q\) debe ser verdadero.  
   Pero no sabemos si María dijo la verdad, solo sabemos lo que ella dijo.  

4. **Conclusión**  
   El enunciado no nos dice si María dijo la verdad o no.

---

**1. Datos del enunciado:**

- El loro está en la jaula. (Verdadero)
- El perro está en la caseta. (Irrelevante para la implicación sobre Tomás)
- Tomás no trajo pizza. (Verdadero)
- María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza».

En lógica, la frase de María es:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]
donde:  
\(P\) = ""El loro está en la jaula""  
\(Q\) = ""Tomás traerá pizza""

---

**2. Valores de verdad de \(P\) y \(Q\) según el contexto:**

- \(P\) es verdadero (dato: ""El loro está en la jaula"").
- \(Q\) es falso (dato: ""Tomás no trajo pizza"").

---

**3. Evaluar la implicación \(P \rightarrow Q\):**

La tabla de verdad de \(P \rightarrow Q\) es:  
- Si \(P\) es verdadero y \(Q\) es falso, entonces \(P \rightarrow Q\) es **falso**.

---

**4. Interpretación de ""Según lo que decía María"":**

La pregunta es:  
> ¿Es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza **según lo que decía María**?

Es decir, si asumimos que lo que María dijo es cierto, ¿qué se deduce sobre \(Q\)?

Si María dice la verdad, entonces \(P \rightarrow Q\) es verdadero.  
Pero sabemos que \(P\) es verdadero.  
Para que \(P \rightarrow Q\) sea verdadero cuando \(P\) es verdadero, \(Q\) debe ser verdadero.

Por lo tanto, **si María dice la verdad**, Tomás trajo pizza.

---

**5. Contradicción con los hechos:**

El contexto nos dice que Tomás **no** trajo pizza.  
Eso significa que lo que María dijo **no es verdad** en la realidad.  

Pero la pregunta no pregunta si María dijo la verdad, sino:  
> Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?

Bajo la suposición de que María dice la verdad, la respuesta es **sí**.

---

**6. Respuesta final:**

Si María dice la verdad, entonces Tomás trajo pizza.  
La pregunta pide la conclusión bajo el supuesto de que María dice la verdad, no según los hechos reales.

\boxed{Sí}

S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

---

**1. Traducir a lógica proposicional**

- \( P \): ""El loro está en la jaula""
- \( Q \): ""Tomás traerá pizza""

María dijo:  
\[
P \rightarrow Q
\]
Es decir: ""Si el loro está en la jaula, entonces Tomás traerá pizza"".

---

**2. Datos del contexto**

- ""El loro no está en la jaula"": \( \neg P \) (verdadero)
- ""El perro tampoco está en la caseta"" (esta parte no afecta a \(P\) ni a \(Q\) directamente, es información extra).

---

**3. Evaluar \(P \rightarrow Q\) con \(P\) falso**

En lógica, una implicación \(P \rightarrow Q\) es verdadera cuando \(P\) es falso, sin importar el valor de \(Q\).  
Es decir: si \(P\) es falso, \(P \rightarrow Q\) es **verdadera** para cualquier \(Q\).

---

**4. Conclusión**

Sabemos que María dijo \(P \rightarrow Q\) y que \(P\) es falso.  
Eso **no** nos permite concluir que \(Q\) sea verdadero o falso.  
Solo sabemos que la afirmación de María es verdadera (porque \(P\) es falso), pero no podemos determinar si Tomás trajo pizza o no.

**Respuesta final:**  
No se puede determinar si Tomás trajo pizza solo con esta información.

   - Si la implicación es cierta y el antecedente (""soleado"") es verdadero, entonces el consecuente (""Emma va de morado"") debe ser verdadero.

4. **Conclusión**:
   - Según la afirmación de María y el hecho de que está soleado, **sí es verdad que Emma fue de morado**.

**Respuesta:** Sí, es verdad."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.  

1. **Premisas**  
   - Hoy el tiempo está soleado.  
   - María dijo: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".  
   - Emma fue de verde.  

2. **Forma lógica**  
   La afirmación de María es:  
   \[
   \text{Soleado} \implies \text{Emma va de morado}
   \]  
   Sabemos que **Soleado = verdadero** (por el contexto).  

3. **Evaluación de la implicación**  
   Si el antecedente (Soleado) es verdadero, para que la implicación sea verdadera, el consecuente (Emma va de morado) debe ser verdadero.  
   Pero el contexto dice: ""Emma fue de verde"", es decir, **Emma va de morado = falso**.  

4. **Conclusión sobre lo que dijo María**  
   Con antecedente verdadero y consecuente falso, la implicación **es falsa**.  
   Es decir, lo que María dijo **no se cumplió**.  

5. **Respuesta a la pregunta**  
   La pregunta es: ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?  
   No, es falso, porque Emma fue de verde.  

**Respuesta final:** No."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.  

1. María dijo:  
> ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".  

Esto es una implicación lógica:  
**Soleado → Morado**  

2. Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso y con mucho viento.  
Es decir: **No soleado** (¬Soleado).  

3. En lógica, si el antecedente (Soleado) es falso, la implicación **Soleado → Morado** es verdadera sin importar si Emma fue de morado o no.  
Pero eso no nos dice si Emma fue de morado; solo que la promesa de María no se incumplió.  

4. Pregunta: ¿Es verdad que Emma fue de morado?  
No podemos concluir que sí, porque la condición (soleado) no se cumplió. Emma podría haber ido de morado por otras razones, o no. Con la información dada, no hay base para afirmar que fue de morado.  

**Respuesta:** No se puede determinar con la información dada; lo más preciso es que no es necesariamente verdad.  

**Answer:** No necesariamente."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

1. **Premisas**:
   - El parque infantil está vacío.
   - María dijo: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".

2. **Forma lógica**:
   - P: ""El parque infantil está vacío"" → **Verdadero** (dato del contexto).
   - Q: ""Júlia se hará un selfie"".
   - María dijo: P → Q.

3. **Evaluación**:
   - P es verdadero.
   - P → Q es una afirmación que María hizo, pero no sabemos si P → Q es verdad en la realidad, solo sabemos que María lo dijo.  
   - Para que P → Q sea verdadero cuando P es verdadero, Q debe ser verdadero.

4. **Problema**:  
   El enunciado no nos dice que la afirmación de María sea cierta, solo nos dice que ella la dijo.  
   Por lo tanto, aunque P sea verdadero, no podemos concluir que Q sea verdadero a menos que sepamos que la implicación P → Q es verdadera (no solo dicha por María).

5. **Conclusión**:
   - No hay información suficiente para afirmar que Júlia se hizo un selfie.  
   - La respuesta es: **No se puede determinar con certeza**.

**Respuesta final**: No necesariamente."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

1. **Premisas**:
   - El parque infantil está vacío. (Verdadero)
   - María dijo: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".  
     Esto es: \( P \rightarrow Q \), donde  
     \( P \): ""El parque infantil está vacío""  
     \( Q \): ""Júlia se hará un selfie""

2. **Datos adicionales**:
   - Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. (Es decir, \( Q \) es Falso)

3. **Aplicación de la implicación**:
   - \( P \) es Verdadero (parque vacío).
   - \( Q \) es Falso (no se hizo selfie).
   - En lógica, \( P \rightarrow Q \) es Falso cuando \( P \) es Verdadero y \( Q \) es Falso.

4. **Conclusión sobre lo que dijo María**:
   - María afirmó \( P \rightarrow Q \), pero en la realidad \( P \) es V y \( Q \) es F,  
     por lo tanto la afirmación de María es **Falsa** en este caso.

5. **Pregunta del problema**:
   - La pregunta es: ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?  
     La respuesta es **No**, porque sabemos que Júlia no se hizo un selfie.

S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

1. **Enunciado de María**:  
   ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".  
   Esto es una implicación lógica:  
   \[
   P \rightarrow Q
   \]
   donde:  
   \(P\): ""El parque infantil está vacío""  
   \(Q\): ""Júlia se hará un selfie""

2. **Contexto real**:  
   ""El parque infantil está lleno"" → Esto significa \(P\) es **falso** (el parque no está vacío).

3. **Regla lógica**:  
   Una implicación \(P \rightarrow Q\) es **verdadera** si \(P\) es falso, independientemente del valor de \(Q\).  
   Es decir, si \(P\) es falso, la implicación es verdadera, pero eso **no nos dice si \(Q\) es verdadero o falso**.

4. **Conclusión**:  
   Dado que \(P\) es falso, no podemos deducir \(Q\).  
   Por lo tanto, **no podemos afirmar que Júlia se hizo un selfie** basándonos solo en la declaración de María y el contexto dado.

**Respuesta final**:  
No necesariamente; no se puede concluir que Júlia se hizo un selfie."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","Vamos a analizar la información paso a paso.

1. **Premisas**:
   - El césped ha sido cortado.
   - Las flores han sido regadas.
   - María dijo: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"".

2. **Condición de María**:
   - La frase es una implicación lógica:  
     **""Si Pablo corta el césped → Pablo recibe 50 euros""**.

3. **Dato relevante**:
   - Sabemos que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero **no se dice explícitamente que lo haya cortado Pablo**.
   - Podría haberlo cortado otra persona.

4. **Conclusión**:
   - Para que Pablo reciba 50 euros, se debe cumplir:  
     1. Que Pablo cortara el césped (antecedente verdadero).  
     2. Que María cumpla su palabra (la implicación sea verdadera).
   - Como no sabemos si fue Pablo quien cortó el césped, **no podemos afirmar con certeza que recibió 50 euros**.

**Respuesta**: No se puede concluir que sea verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros, porque no está confirmado que Pablo cortara el césped."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","Vamos a analizar la información paso a paso.  

1. **Premisas**  
   - El césped ha sido cortado.  
   - Las flores han sido regadas.  
   - María dijo: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"".  

2. **Condicional de María**  
   La frase es:  
   \[
   \text{Si } P \text{ entonces } Q

   donde:  
   \(P\) = ""Pablo corta el césped""  
   \(Q\) = ""Pablo recibe 50 euros""  

3. **Sabemos que el césped ha sido cortado**

4. **Lógica del condicional**  
   Para que \(Q\) sea verdad, necesitamos que \(P\) sea verdad.  
   Si \(P\) es falso (es decir, Pablo no cortó el césped), el condicional no nos dice nada sobre \(Q\): podría recibir o no los 50 euros por otra razón, pero la promesa de María no se activa.  

5. **Conclusión**  
   Como no se afirma que Pablo cortó el césped, **no podemos concluir** que Pablo recibió 50 euros basándonos solo en estas premisas.

1. **Premisas:**
   - El césped no ha sido cortado.
   - Las flores no han sido regadas.
   - María dijo: *""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""*.

2. **Condición de la afirmación de María:**
   La frase es una implicación lógica:  
   \[
   \text{Pablo corta el césped} \implies \text{Pablo recibe 50 euros}.
   \]
   Esto significa que si la condición (cortar el césped) se cumple, entonces Pablo recibirá 50 euros.  
   Si la condición no se cumple, la promesa no nos dice nada sobre si recibe o no el dinero.

3. **Situación real:**
   Sabemos que *el césped no ha sido cortado*.  
   Por lo tanto, la condición (Pablo corta el césped) es **falsa**.

4. **Conclusión lógica:**
   En lógica, cuando el antecedente de una implicación es falso, la implicación es verdadera sin importar el consecuente.  
   Pero eso no significa que el consecuente sea verdadero; solo que la promesa de María no se ha incumplido.

   Para saber si *Pablo recibió 50 euros*, necesitaríamos que el antecedente fuera verdadero o alguna otra información.  
   Como el antecedente es falso, **no podemos concluir que Pablo recibió 50 euros**.

**Respuesta:** No, no es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros (no hay evidencia de ello según los datos)."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

1. **Premisas**:
   - El perro está jugando. (Hecho dado en el contexto)
   - María dijo: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"".  
     Esto es una implicación lógica:  
     \( P \rightarrow Q \)  
     donde \( P \): ""El perro está jugando""  
     \( Q \): ""Antonio lee un libro"".

2. **Datos**:
   - \( P \) es verdadero (por el contexto).

3. **Regla de inferencia**:
   - De \( P \rightarrow Q \) y \( P \) se deduce \( Q \) (Modus ponens).

4. **Conclusión**:
   - Según la afirmación de María y el hecho de que el perro está jugando, Antonio debería leer un libro.

Sin embargo, hay un detalle: la pregunta es **""¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?""**  
El razonamiento anterior nos dice que, según la declaración de María, Antonio *debería* leer un libro, pero no sabemos si María dijo la verdad.  
Si asumimos que María dijo la verdad, entonces sí, Antonio leyó un libro.  
Si no asumimos que María dijo la verdad, no podemos asegurarlo.

Dado que el contexto no explicita si María miente o dice la verdad, pero en lógica proposicional típica de estos ejercicios se suele asumir que las declaraciones dadas son verdaderas, la respuesta sería:

**Sí, es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro** (bajo el supuesto de que María dijo la verdad)."

   - Sabemos que \( P \) es falso (por el contexto: ""El perro no está jugando"").

3. **Evaluación de \( P \rightarrow Q \) cuando \( P\) es falso:**
   - La implicación \( P \rightarrow Q \) es verdadera cuando \( P \) es falso, sin importar el valor de \( Q \).
   - Es decir, si \( P \) es falso, la proposición ""Si P entonces Q"" es **verdadera** (no dice nada sobre Q en ese caso).

4. **Conclusión:**
   - La afirmación de María es verdadera en esta situación, pero **no podemos concluir que Antonio leyó un libro**.
   - Solo sabemos que la frase condicional de María es verdadera porque el perro no está jugando.

5. **Respuesta a la pregunta:**
   - La pregunta es: ""¿Es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?""
   - No hay información para determinar si \( Q \) es verdadero o falso. Solo sabemos que \( P \) es falso, lo que hace \( P \rightarrow Q \) verdadero, pero no nos dice nada sobre \( Q \).

S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Vamos a analizar la lógica paso a paso.

1. **Premisas**:
   - La nevera está vacía. (Verdadero)
   - El horno está estropeado. (No afecta directamente a la implicación sobre los donuts).
   - María dijo: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"".  
     Esto es una implicación lógica: \( P \rightarrow Q \), donde:  
     \( P \): ""La nevera está vacía""  
     \( Q \): ""Ana traerá donuts""

2. **Valor de \( P \)**:  
   Sabemos que \( P \) es verdadero (la nevera está vacía).

3. **Implicación \( P \rightarrow Q \)**:  
   Si \( P \) es verdadero, para que \( P \rightarrow Q \) sea verdadero, \( Q \) debe ser verdadero.  
   Pero aquí hay un detalle importante: la frase de María es un condicional que ella *dijo*, no necesariamente un hecho del mundo real.  
   El enunciado no afirma que lo que María dijo sea verdad, solo lo reporta.

4. **Conclusión**:  
   Como no sabemos si la afirmación de María es cierta (podría haber mentido o estar equivocada), el hecho de que la nevera esté vacía no garantiza lógicamente que Ana trajera donuts, a menos que asumamos que María dijo la verdad.  
   El problema no explicita que María siempre dice la verdad, así que **no podemos concluir con certeza que Ana trajo donuts**.

**Respuesta**: No se puede afirmar que es verdad que Ana trajo donuts, porque no sabemos si el condicional de María es verdadero."
