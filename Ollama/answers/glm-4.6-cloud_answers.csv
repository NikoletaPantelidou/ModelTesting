B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven."" This is a conditional statement. It sets up a rule: If a condition is met, a result will follow.
2.  **The Condition:** ""John is hungry.""
3.  **The Result:** ""There is pizza in the oven.""

We are told that John is hungry, which means the condition is met. According to the rule Mary provided, if the condition is met, the result must be true. Therefore, we can conclude that there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven."" This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).
2.  **The Condition:** We are told that ""John is hungry."" The condition (P) is met.
3.  **The Conclusion:** Therefore, if we accept Mary's statement as a true premise, the conclusion (Q) must follow. The conclusion is that ""there is pizza in the oven.""

**Important Note:** The context also tells us that ""there is no pizza in the oven."" This creates a contradiction. This contradiction proves that Mary's statement is false.

However, the question asks what is true **""Based on what Mary says.""** Following the logic of her statement, the only possible conclusion is that there is pizza in the oven."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot determine if it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **A** is true, then **B** is true.""
*   **A** = ""John is hungry""
*   **B** = ""there is pizza in the oven""

We know from the context that **A is false** (John is not hungry).

In logic, when the ""if"" part of a statement (the antecedent) is false, the entire statement is considered true, but it tells us nothing about the ""then"" part (the consequent).

Think of it this way: Mary only made a promise about what would happen *if* John were hungry. Since he isn't, her promise isn't broken, but it also doesn't give us any information. The pizza could be in the oven, or it could be gone. We simply don't know from her statement alone."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

Here is the reasoning based on Mary's statement:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""
2.  From the context, we know the first part of that condition is true: ""Nicole's head hurts.""
3.  In logic, if the ""if"" part of a true ""if-then"" statement is true, then the ""then"" part must also be true.

Therefore, based on Mary's statement and the fact that Nicole's head hurts, we can conclude that there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Based *only* on what Mary says, we cannot determine if there is aspirin on the table.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If P, then Q.""
*   P = Nicole's head hurts.
*   Q = There is aspirin on the table.

This statement only tells us the relationship between P and Q. It does not, by itself, confirm that P is true or that Q is true. It's like saying, ""If it rains, the ground will be wet."" This statement doesn't tell you if it's currently raining or if the ground is wet.

However, if we consider the *entire context* provided, we know that:
1.  Nicole's head hurts (P is true).
2.  There is no aspirin on the table (Q is false).

This means that Mary's statement (""If P, then Q"") is false. But the question specifically asks what is true *based on what Mary says*, and her statement alone is not enough to confirm the presence of aspirin."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **P** is true, then **Q** is true.""
    *   **P** = Nicole's head hurts.
    *   **Q** = There is aspirin on the table.

2.  The context tells us that Nicole's head does **not** hurt. This means the ""if"" part (**P**) of Mary's statement is false.

3.  In logic, when the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything about the ""then"" part (**Q**). The ""then"" part could be true or false.

Think of it this way: If someone says, ""If it is raining, I will take my umbrella,"" and it is not raining, you don't know if they have an umbrella or not. They might have it for other reasons.

Therefore, based only on Mary's statement, we cannot determine whether there is aspirin on the table. There might be, there might not be. Her statement only covers the situation where Nicole's head *does* hurt."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No, based *only* on what Mary says, you cannot conclude that there is water in the fridge.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **P** is true, then **Q** is true.""
*   **P** = Lucy is thirsty.
*   **Q** = There is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement only tells you the relationship between P and Q. It does not, by itself, confirm that P is true.

To know for sure that there is water in the fridge (Q), you would need two pieces of information:
1.  Mary's statement: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""
2.  The fact that: ""Lucy is thirsty.""

Since the question asks you to base your answer *only* on what Mary says, you are missing the second piece of information. Mary's statement would be true even if Lucy wasn't thirsty and there was no water."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **The Context:** The context explicitly states, ""There is no water in the fridge."" This is a given fact.
2.  **Mary's Statement:** Mary says, ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""
3.  **The Contradiction:** We know Lucy is thirsty (the ""if"" part is true). However, we also know there is no water in the fridge (the ""then"" part is false).

When the ""if"" part of a statement is true, but the ""then"" part is false, the entire statement is false. Therefore, Mary's statement is false.

Because the context provides the factual information that there is no water, we must conclude that there is no water in the fridge, regardless of what Mary says."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, it is **not possible to determine** if there is water in the fridge.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If A, then B.""
    *   A = Lucy is thirsty.
    *   B = There is water in the fridge.

2.  The context tells us that Lucy is **not thirsty**. This means the ""if"" part (A) of Mary's statement is false.

3.  In logic, a conditional statement (""If A, then B"") is only considered false if the ""if"" part (A) is true and the ""then"" part (B) is false.

4.  Since the ""if"" part (A) is false, Mary's statement is true regardless of whether there is water in the fridge or not. Her statement only makes a claim about the situation *if* Lucy were thirsty. It says nothing about what happens when she isn't.

Therefore, based only on Mary's statement, we cannot conclude whether there is water in the fridge. There might be, or there might not be."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true based only on what Mary says.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""

This statement only guarantees the presence of the charger **if** the condition (the phone being dead) is true. It does not, by itself, confirm that the phone is actually dead.

Based *only* on Mary's words, there are two possibilities:

1.  **The phone is dead:** In this case, Mary's statement would be true, and there would be a charger in the drawer.
2.  **The phone is not dead:** In this case, Mary's statement is still true (the ""if"" condition wasn't met), but it tells us nothing about whether there is a charger or not.

Since we don't know from Mary's statement whether the phone is dead, we cannot conclude for certain that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true based only on what Mary says.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If A, then B.""
*   A = Peter's phone is dead.
*   B = There is a charger in the drawer.

This statement only tells us that B is true *if* A is true. It does not, by itself, prove that B is true. To conclude that there is a charger in the drawer, you would need to know two things:
1.  Mary's statement is true.
2.  The condition ""Peter's phone is dead"" is met.

The question asks you to base your answer *only* on what Mary says. Her statement alone is not enough to prove the existence of the charger."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **A** is true, then **B** is true.""
    *   **A** = ""Peter's phone is dead.""
    *   **B** = ""There is a charger in the drawer.""

2.  The context tells us that Peter's phone is **fully charged**. This means that condition **A** is false.

3.  When the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything about the ""then"" part. Mary only made a promise about what would happen *if* the phone were dead. Since that condition isn't met, her statement doesn't apply to the current situation.

**Analogy:** If someone says, ""If it rains tomorrow, I will wear my red coat,"" and it does **not** rain, you have no idea whether they own a red coat or not. They might wear it for another reason, or they might not.

Therefore, based only on what Mary says, we cannot determine if there is a charger in the drawer. There might be, or there might not be."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is rainy (A), then there is an umbrella on the coat rack (B).""
2.  The context establishes that the condition (A) is met: ""The weather is rainy.""
3.  In logic, if the ""if"" part of a true statement is true, then the ""then"" part must also be true.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. This is also confirmed by the initial context provided."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Here is the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** She makes a conditional statement: ""If the weather is rainy (A), then there is an umbrella on the coat rack (B).""
2.  **The Condition:** The context confirms that the condition (A) is true: ""The weather is rainy.""
3.  **The Conclusion:** According to the rules of logic, if you accept the ""if/then"" statement as true, and the ""if"" part is true, then the ""then"" part must also be true.

Therefore, if you take Mary's statement at face value, you must conclude that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

**The Contradiction:**

This conclusion directly contradicts the fact given in the context that ""there is no umbrella on the coat rack."" This contradiction proves that Mary's statement is false. However, the question asks what is true *based on what Mary says*, not what is true in reality."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true. We cannot determine if there is an umbrella on the coat rack based on what Mary says.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is rainy (the condition), then there is an umbrella on the coat rack (the result).""

The context tells us that ""the weather is sunny."" Since the condition (rainy weather) is not met, Mary's statement does not apply. Her statement gives us no information about what happens when the weather is sunny. The umbrella might be there, or it might not be. We simply don't know."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional rule: ""If **your tire is flat**, then **there is a pump in the garage**.""
2.  The context confirms that the condition ""your tire is flat"" is true.
3.  Since the condition is true, the consequence of the rule must also be true.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is a pump in the garage."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is a pump in the garage.

Here is the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** This is a conditional statement: ""If P, then Q.""
    *   P = ""your tire is flat""
    *   Q = ""there is a pump in the garage""

2.  **The Condition is Met:** The context states that ""your tire is flat."" This means the ""if"" part (P) of Mary's statement is true.

3.  **Applying the Logic:** In a true ""If P, then Q"" statement, if P is true, then Q must also be true. Since we are asked to base our answer *on what Mary says*, we must follow the logic of her statement.

Therefore, based on the rule Mary provided, the conclusion is that there is a pump in the garage.

**Important Note:** The context also tells us that ""there is no pump in the garage."" This means that while the conclusion based on Mary's statement is ""yes,"" Mary's statement itself is actually false in this situation. The question, however, specifically asks you to follow the logic of her statement, not to evaluate its truthfulness against the other facts."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **A** is true, then **B** is true.""
    *   **A** = ""your tire is flat""
    *   **B** = ""there is a pump in the garage""

2.  The context tells us that **A** is false (""Your tire is not flat"").

3.  A conditional statement (""If A, then B"") only tells you what happens when the ""if"" part (A) is true. It says nothing about what happens when the ""if"" part is false.

Because the condition (the tire being flat) is not met, Mary's statement doesn't apply. The pump might be in the garage, or it might not be. We cannot conclude anything about the pump's location based on her statement alone."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true.

Here is the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **the plant is dry**, then **there is a water can on the shelf**.""
2.  The context tells us that the condition ""the plant is dry"" is true.
3.  Since the condition is true, the result of her statement must also be true.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, we can conclude that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **The Context:** The context explicitly states, ""There is no water can on the shelf.""
2.  **Mary's Statement:** Mary says, ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.""
3.  **The Logic:** We know the plant *is* dry (the condition is met). However, the result (a water can on the shelf) is not true. This means Mary's statement is false.

Therefore, based on the facts provided, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on what Mary says, it is **not possible to determine** if there is a water can on the shelf.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the plant is dry (A), then there is a water can on the shelf (B).""

The context tells us that the plant is **not dry**. This means the ""if"" part of Mary's statement (A) is false.

When the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the statement itself doesn't give us any information about the ""then"" part. The water can might be on the shelf for other reasons, or it might not be. Both possibilities are consistent with Mary's statement.

Therefore, we cannot conclude whether the water can is on the shelf or not. The information about the hose is also irrelevant to this specific question."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If George's shirt is wrinkled (A), there is an iron in the closet (B)."" This is a conditional statement: If A, then B.
2.  **The Condition (A):** The context confirms that ""George's shirt is wrinkled."" So, the condition A is true.
3.  **The Conclusion (B):** Because the condition (A) is true, the conclusion (B) that Mary linked to it must also be true.

This is a basic rule of logic called *modus ponens*: If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **The Context is the Source of Truth:** The problem setup explicitly states, ""there is no iron in the closet."" This is a fact within the scenario.
2.  **Mary's Statement is False:** Mary says, ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet."" We know from the context that the shirt *is* wrinkled (the ""if"" part is true) and there *is no* iron (the ""then"" part is false). In logic, a conditional ""If P, then Q"" is false when P is true and Q is false. Therefore, Mary's statement is incorrect.

The question asks if it's true that there is an iron in the closet. Based on the facts of the context, the answer is no. Mary's statement doesn't change the reality of the situation; it just makes her statement wrong."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on what Mary says, it is **not necessarily true** that there is an iron in the closet.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If P, then Q.""
*   **P:** George's shirt is wrinkled.
*   **Q:** There is an iron in the closet.

The context tells us that P is **false** (the shirt is not wrinkled).

In logic, when the ""if"" part of a statement (P) is false, the statement as a whole is considered true, regardless of whether the ""then"" part (Q) is true or false. Mary's statement is only proven false if the shirt *is* wrinkled (P is true) and there is *no* iron in the closet (Q is false).

Since the shirt is not wrinkled, Mary's statement holds true, but it gives us no information about the closet. There might be an iron in the closet, or there might not be. We simply can't know from her statement alone."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is not necessarily true based *only* on what Mary says.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional ""if-then"" statement: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf.""

This statement is only false if the ""if"" part is true and the ""then"" part is false (i.e., Susy wants to read, but there are no books).

However, if Susy did **not** want to read, Mary's statement would still be true regardless of whether there were books on the shelf or not.

Because Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about the situation if Susy *doesn't* want to read, we cannot conclude for certain that there are books on the shelf based on her words alone."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there are books on the shelf.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **A** is true, then **B** is true.""
    *   **A** = Susy wants to read.
    *   **B** = There are books on the shelf.

2.  The context tells us that **A** is true (Susy wants to read).

3.  In logic, if you accept the ""if"" part of a statement as true, you must also accept the ""then"" part as true.

Therefore, if we follow the rule that Mary has established, and we know Susy wants to read, then we must conclude that there are books on the shelf.

*(Note: This conclusion is based purely on the logic of Mary's statement, even though it contradicts the other information given in the context.)*"
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf.""

The context tells us that ""Susy does not want to read."" This means the condition (the ""if"" part) is false.

In logic, when the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the statement itself is considered true, but it tells us nothing about the truth of the ""then"" part.

*   Mary's statement would be true if there **are** books on the shelf.
*   Mary's statement would also be true if there are **no** books on the shelf, because the condition for her statement to be relevant (Susy wanting to read) is not met.

Since both possibilities are consistent with what Mary said, we cannot confirm that there are books on the shelf based on her statement alone."
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Yes.

Based on the context, pizza is more popular than pasta because ""people buy it more."""
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?","No.

The context states that ""people buy it more,"" referring to pizza. Since more people are buying pizza than pasta, pizza is more popular."
F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","Based on the context, we cannot be certain.

The text states that ""most people **prefer** green tea,"" but it does not explicitly state which one is **used** more. Preference is not the same as usage."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","No.

Based on the context, black coffee is not more used than green tea. The text explicitly states that ""most people prefer green tea,"" which implies that green tea is consumed more often than black coffee. The fact that there is coffee in the pot only means it is available, not that it is used more."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Yes. The context states that ""many choose soda,"" which directly implies a high demand for it. The text contrasts this with the fact that water is healthier, but it doesn't provide any information suggesting that water's demand is higher."
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","Based on the context provided, the answer is:

No.

Here's why:

The context states, ""...many choose soda."" This is a direct statement about people's choices, which indicates a high demand for soda. The fact that there is water in the freezer only speaks to its availability, not its demand. The text provides no information to suggest that more people are choosing water."
F4T,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context, is broccoli more popular than gnocchi?","Yes, according to the context, broccoli is more popular than gnocchi because ""people use it more."""
F4F,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context,  are gnocchi more popular than broccoli?","No. According to the context, ""people use [broccoli] more"" than gnocchi. This means broccoli is more popular than gnocchi."
F5T,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, are burgers more popular than sushi?","Yes. The context states that ""people eat burgers more often,"" which indicates that burgers are more popular than sushi."
F5F,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, is sushi more popular than burgers?","No.

Based on the context provided, sushi is not more popular than burgers. The text explicitly states that ""people eat burgers more often,"" which implies that burgers are more popular. The fact that there is sushi on the table only describes the current situation and does not contradict the general statement about popularity."
F6T,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are bananas more popular than kiwis?","Yes.

The context states that ""people purchase them more"" than kiwis. Higher purchase volume is a direct indicator of greater popularity. The fact that this is true even though bananas are more expensive further supports this conclusion."

Based on the context, kiwis are not more popular than bananas. The text explicitly states that ""people purchase them [bananas] more,"" which indicates that bananas are the more popular fruit."
F7T,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are dogs more popular than cats?","Yes.

Based on the context, the first sentence states, ""Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them."" In this sentence, the pronoun ""them"" refers to dogs. Therefore, if people prefer dogs, they are more popular. The second sentence about the cat in the tree is irrelevant to the question of popularity."
F7F,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are cats more popular than dogs?","No.

The context states that ""people prefer them,"" and in that sentence, ""them"" refers to dogs. This indicates that dogs are more popular than cats. The information about the cat in the tree is not relevant to the question of popularity."
F8T,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people watching TV than reading books?","Yes.

The context explicitly states, ""most people watch TV."" This directly answers the question, indicating that the number of people watching TV is greater than the number of people reading books."
F8F,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people reading books than watching TV?","No.

F9T,English,"Here's the context: Although running is better for fitness than walking, most people prefer walking. There is a runner on the track. In this context, is walking more popular than running? ","Yes.

The context explicitly states, ""...most people prefer walking."" This directly indicates that walking is more popular than running. The fact that there is a runner on the track is a specific instance and does not contradict the general statement about what most people prefer."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that Thomas brought pizza.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza."" This sets up a condition and a result.
2.  **The Context:** ""The parrot is in the cage."" This confirms that the condition in Mary's statement has been met.
3.  **The Conclusion:** Since the condition (the parrot being in the cage) is true, the result (Thomas bringing pizza) must also be true according to the rule Mary established.

The information about the dog in the doghouse is extra detail that is not relevant to the conclusion about the pizza."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No.

Based on the context provided, it is explicitly stated: ""Thomas did not bring pizza.""

This creates a contradiction with Mary's statement. Mary said, ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza."" Since the parrot is in the cage, her statement was proven to be false."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on what Mary says, it is **not necessarily true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If **A** happens, then **B** will happen.""
    *   **A** = The parrot is in the cage.
    *   **B** = Thomas will bring pizza.

2.  We know that **A did not happen** (the parrot is not in the cage).

3.  Mary's statement only tells us what happens *if* the parrot is in the cage. It gives us no information about what happens if the parrot is *not* in the cage. Thomas might have brought pizza for another reason, or he might not have brought it at all.

Therefore, based only on the information given, we cannot conclude that Thomas brought pizza."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes.

Based on what Mary says, the condition for getting a candy was finishing your broccoli. Since you finished your broccoli, Mark gave you a candy."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes.

Based on Mary's statement, a rule was set: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""

You finished the broccoli, which fulfills the condition of the rule. Therefore, according to Mary's statement, it is true that Mark gave you a candy."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on what Mary says, it is not possible to tell.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement was a conditional promise: ""If you finish your broccoli (the condition), then Mark will give you a candy (the result).""

Since you did not finish the broccoli, the condition was not met. The promise doesn't tell us what happens if the condition isn't met. Mark might have given you a candy for another reason, or he might not have. We only know what would have happened if you *had* finished your broccoli."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera."" This sets up a condition.
2.  **The Context:** ""The foxes are dancing."" This confirms that the condition in Mary's statement has been met.
3.  **Conclusion:** Because the condition (the foxes are dancing) is true, the result (Susan will get a camera) must also be true, according to what Mary said.

The information about the squirrels eating is extra detail that doesn't affect this conclusion."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary made a conditional statement: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""
2.  The context confirms that the condition is met: ""The foxes are dancing.""
3.  Therefore, according to the rule Mary set, the result must be true: Susan got a camera.

The information about the squirrels and the shovel is irrelevant to this conclusion."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on what Mary says, it is not possible to determine if Susan got a camera.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the foxes are dancing, then Susan will get a camera.""

This statement only tells us what happens *if* the condition (the foxes dancing) is met. We are told that the foxes are **not** dancing. Since the condition was not met, Mary's statement doesn't give us any information about what happened otherwise.

Think of it like this: ""If it rains, I will take my umbrella."" If it doesn't rain, you don't know if I have my umbrella or not. I might have it for the sun, or I might have left it at home.

Similarly, because the foxes were not dancing, we don't know if Susan got a camera or not. She might have gotten it for another reason, or she might not have gotten it at all. The information is insufficient."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional rule: ""If the TV is on (condition), then Matthew will bake cookies (result).""
2.  The context tells us the condition is met: ""The TV is on.""
3.  Therefore, based on Mary's rule, the result must be true: Matthew baked cookies."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes.

Based on what Mary says, Matthew baked cookies. Here is the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Rule:** ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""
2.  **The Condition:** We are told that ""The TV is on.""
3.  **The Conclusion:** According to Mary's rule, since the condition (the TV is on) has been met, the outcome (Matthew will bake cookies) must be true.

***

**Important Note:** The context also states that ""Matthew did not bake cookies."" This creates a contradiction. It means that one of the statements you were given is false. Since the question specifically asks you to base the answer *on what Mary says*, we follow her logic, which implies that the statement ""Matthew did not bake cookies"" is the incorrect one."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on the information provided, it is **not possible to determine** if Matthew baked cookies.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""

This statement only tells us what happens *if the TV is on*. Since the TV is actually off, the condition for her statement was not met. We don't know what Matthew does when the TV is off. He might have baked cookies anyway for another reason, or he might not have. The information we have is insufficient to say for sure."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that Emma wore purple.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple."" This sets up a clear rule.
2.  **The Condition:** The context states, ""Today, the weather is sunny."" This means the condition for Mary's rule has been met.
3.  **The Conclusion:** Since the condition (sunny weather) is true, the outcome (Emma wearing purple) must also be true, according to the rule Mary provided.

The fact that there is no wind is extra information that doesn't affect Mary's statement."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on the information provided, the answer is **no**.

Here is the logical breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""
2.  **The Condition:** The context confirms the weather is sunny.
3.  **The Contradiction:** The context also states, ""Emma is wearing green.""

This means Mary's statement was incorrect. While her statement *predicted* Emma would wear purple, the actual fact is that she is wearing green. Therefore, it is not true that Emma wore purple."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on what Mary says, it is not necessarily true that Emma wore purple.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""
2.  The context states that the weather is rainy.
3.  Since the condition (""the weather is sunny"") was not met, Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about what Emma actually wore. She might have worn purple, or she might have worn something else.

Therefore, based only on the information given, we cannot conclude that Emma wore purple."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that Angela took a selfie.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional promise: ""If **the playground is empty** (the condition), then **Angela will take a selfie** (the result).""
2.  The context confirms that the condition is met: ""The playground is empty.""
3.  Since the condition is true, the result must follow according to the rule Mary established.

Therefore, based on the information given, we can conclude that Angela took a selfie. The fact that the streets are quiet is extra information that doesn't affect this conclusion."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No.

Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie."" This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q).
2.  **The Condition is Met:** The context states, ""The playground is empty."" So, the ""if"" part of Mary's statement is true.
3.  **The Contradiction:** According to the logic of Mary's statement, if the playground is empty, Angela *should have* taken a selfie. However, the context explicitly states, ""Angela did not take a selfie.""
4.  **Conclusion:** The fact that Angela did not take a selfie proves that Mary's statement was false. Therefore, based on the facts provided, it is not true that Angela took a selfie."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on what Mary says, it is not possible to determine if Angela took a selfie.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""
2.  The context tells us the playground is **crowded**, which means the condition (""the playground is empty"") was not met.
3.  Mary's statement only tells us what happens *if* the condition is met. It gives us no information about what happens when the playground is crowded.

Therefore, Angela might have taken a selfie for other reasons, or she might not have. We simply don't have enough information to say for sure."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based on the information provided, it is not necessarily true that Paul got 50 euros.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional promise: ""If **Paul** mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""
2.  We know the lawn has been mowed, but we do not know **who** mowed it.
3.  Someone else could have mowed the lawn (e.g., Mary, a gardener, a neighbor).

Because we cannot confirm that Paul was the one who mowed the lawn, we cannot conclude that he met the condition to receive the 50 euros."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.

Here's the reasoning based on the context:

1.  **Direct Statement:** The context explicitly says, ""Paul did not get 50 euros.""
2.  **Mary's Statement:** Mary said, ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""
3.  **The Contradiction:** The lawn was mowed, but Paul did not get the money. This means the condition of Mary's statement was met, but the outcome she promised did not happen. Therefore, Mary's statement was proven to be false.

However, the fact that Mary's statement was false does not change the actual outcome. The outcome, as stated in the context, is that Paul did not get the 50 euros."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""

This statement only tells us the outcome *if* the condition (mowing the lawn) is met. It says nothing about what happens if the condition is *not* met.

Since the lawn was not mowed, Paul's getting 50 euros is not guaranteed by Mary's statement. He might have gotten the money for another reason, or he might have gotten nothing at all. We simply don't have enough information to say for sure."

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **Mary's Statement:** ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book."" This sets up a clear cause-and-effect rule.
2.  **The Context:** ""The dog is playing."" This confirms that the condition in Mary's statement is met.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional promise: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""
2.  The context confirms the condition is met: ""The dog is playing.""
3.  According to Mary's statement, because the dog is playing, Anthony *should* have read a book.
4.  However, the context explicitly states: ""Anthony did not read a book.""

Since the condition was true but the outcome was false, Mary's statement was incorrect, and it is not true that Anthony read a book."

Here's the logical breakdown:

1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the dog is playing, then Anthony will read a book.""

B1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i hi ha pizza al forn. També hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Sí, segons la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn.

El raonament és el següent:

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si en Joan té gana (condició), aleshores hi ha pizza al forn (conseqüència)"".

Aquesta frase estableix que la presència de pizza al forn és una conseqüència directa del fet que en Joan tingui gana. Per tant, si acceptem la seva premissa (que en Joan té gana), la conclusió que se'n deriva (que hi ha pizza al forn) també ha de ser certa dins del seu raonament.

En resum: La Maria connecta directament les dues coses. Si la primera és certa, la segona també ho és, segons ella."
B1F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i no hi ha pizza al forn. Tampoc no hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No.

El text diu clarament que ""no hi ha pizza al forn"". Això vol dir que la declaració de la Maria és falsa, ja que la condició (que en Joan té gana) es compleix, però la conseqüència (que hi ha pizza) no."
B1C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan no té gana. Hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No es pot saber.

**Explicació:**

La frase de la Maria és una condició: ""Si en Joan té gana (A), llavors hi ha pizza al forn (B)"".

El que sabem del context és que en Joan **no** té gana (la condició A és falsa).

Quan la part del ""si..."" d'una condició no es compleix, no podem saber res sobre la part del ""llavors..."". La Maria no diu què passa si en Joan no té gana. Potser hi ha pizza per una altra raó, o potser no n'hi ha. La seva afirmació no ens permet determinar-ho."
B2T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","No, segons el que diu la Maria, no es pot afirmar que sigui veritat.

La seva afirmació és una condició (""Si...""). Només ens diu que *en cas que* la Núria tingui mal de cap, aleshores hi haurà aspirines sobre la taula.

Però la seva frase, per si sola, no confirma que la condició (que la Núria tingui mal de cap) sigui certa. Per tant, només basant-nos en el que diu la Maria, no podem saber amb certesa si hi ha aspirines sobre la taula."
B2F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. Tampoc no hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","No.

**Explicació:**

El context diu explícitament que ""no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"".

El que diu la Maria és una condició: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"".

Anem a analitzar-ho:
1.  **La condició és certa:** La Núria té mal de cap.
2.  **La conseqüència és falsa:** No hi ha aspirines sobre la taula.

Com que la condició és certa però la conseqüència és falsa, l'afirmació de la Maria és incorrecta. Per tant, la resposta a la pregunta ""És veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?"" és **no**, tal com indica el context."
B2C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria no té mal de cap. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","No es pot saber.

**Raonament:**

La frase de la Maria (""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"") és una condició. Aquesta condició només ens diu què passaria si la Núria tingués mal de cap.

Com que sabem que la Núria **no** té mal de cap, la condició no es compleix. Per tant, la declaració de la Maria és certa, però no ens dona cap informació sobre si realment hi ha aspirines o no sobre la taula. Podrien ser-hi per una altra raó, o no podrien ser-hi."

**Raonament:**

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si la Llúcia té set (P), llavors hi ha aigua a la nevera (Q)"".

El context ens diu que la condició (P) és certa: ""La Llúcia té set"".

Segons la lògica, si la primera part d'una afirmació ""si... llavors..."" és certa, la segona part també ho ha de ser. Per tant, si acceptem com a vertadera el que diu la Maria, la conclusió lògica és que hi ha aigua a la nevera."

Segons la lògica de l'afirmació de la Maria, si la Llúcia té set (com diu el context), aleshores ha de ser veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera.

La seva frase estableix una condició: ""Si P, aleshores Q"". Com que sabem que P (""la Llúcia té set"") és cert, la conclusió Q (""hi ha aigua a la nevera"") també ho ha de ser, seguint el raonament de la Maria."
B3C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia no té set. Hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No es pot saber.

**Explicació:**

El que diu la Maria és una condició: ""Si la Llúcia té set, aleshores hi ha aigua a la nevera"".

Però el context ens diu que ""La Llúcia **no** té set"".

Com que la condició (que la Llúcia tingui set) no es compleix, la declaració de la Maria no ens dona cap informació sobre si hi ha aigua o no a la nevera. La seva frase només ens diu què passaria en el cas que la Llúcia tingués set, però com que no en té, la seva afirmació no ens ajuda a resoldre el dubte."
B4T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria i hi ha un carregador al calaix. També hi ha un ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","Sí.

**Raonament:**

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria (condició A), hi ha un carregador al calaix (conseqüència B)"".

El context ens diu que la condició A és certa (""El mòbil del Pere no té bateria"").

Per tant, com que la condició A es compleix, la conseqüència B que la Maria en dedueix també ha de ser certa.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix."
B4F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria i no hi ha cap carregador al calaix. Tampoc no hi ha cap ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","Sí, seguint el raonament de la Maria.

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria (condició A), hi ha un carregador al calaix (conseqüència B)"".

Com que el context confirma que la condició A és certa (""el mòbil del Pere no té bateria""), si seguim la lògica de la Maria, la conclusió obligada és que la conseqüència B també ho sigui: ""hi ha un carregador al calaix"".

**Això no obstant**, el context també ens diu explícitament que ""no hi ha cap carregador al calaix"". Això significa que, en realitat, l'afirmació de la Maria és **falsa**."
B4C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere està carregat. Hi ha un ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","No es pot saber.

**Explicació:**
La Maria fa una condició: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"".

Això només ens garanteix que hi ha un carregador en el cas que el mòbil no tingui bateria. Com que el context diu que ""El mòbil del Pere està carregat"", la condició que la Maria posa no es compleix.

Per tant, el que diu la Maria no ens permet saber si hi ha o no hi ha un carregador al calaix."
B5T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El temps és plujós i hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer. També hi ha un impermeable al cotxe. La Maria diu: ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer?","Sí.

Segons el que diu la Maria, la seva afirmació és una condició: ""Si el temps és plujós (condició), aleshores hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer (conseqüència)"".

Com que el context ens diu que ""el temps és plujós"", la condició que ella estableix es compleix. Per tant, seguint la seva lògica, la conclusió és que sí, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer."
B5F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El temps és plujós i no hi ha cap paraigua al paraigüer. Tampoc no hi ha cap impermeable al cotxe.

El context diu explícitament: ""**no hi ha cap paraigua al paraigüer**"".

Això fa que l'afirmació de la Maria (""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"") sigui **falsa** en aquesta situació, perquè es compleix la condició (el temps és plujós) però no es compleix el resultat (no hi ha cap paraigua)."

B6T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La roda del cotxe està punxada i hi ha un inflador al garatge. També hi ha una bicicleta a la porta d'entrada.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","No es pot saber amb certesa segons el que diu la Maria.

**Explicació:**

La frase de la Maria és una condicional: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada (condició A), aleshores hi ha un inflador al garatge (condició B)"".

Aquesta afirmació només ens diu el que passa si la condició A és certa. No ens diu si la condició A és certa o no.

*   **Si la roda estigués punxada**, segons la Maria, sí que hauria d'haver-hi un inflador.
*   **Però si la roda no estigués punxada**, la seva afirmació seguiria sent certa, però no ens diu res sobre si hi ha un inflador o no.

Per tant, basant-nos únicament en la seva frase, no podem confirmar que hi hagi un inflador al garatge.

**Raonament:**

1.  L'afirmació de la Maria és: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge"".
2.  El context ens diu que la primera part de l'afirmació és certa: ""La roda del cotxe està punxada"".

Això només ens diu què passaria si la roda estigués punxada. Com que el context diu que ""la roda del cotxe està inflada"" (és a dir, no està punxada), la condició que la Maria posa no es compleix.

B7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La planta està seca i hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria. També hi ha una mànega al jardí. La Maria diu: ""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria?","Sí.

**Raonament:**

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si la planta està seca (condició A), llavors hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria (conseqüència B)"".

El context ens diu que la condició A (""la planta està seca"") és certa.

Per tant, segons la lògica de la pròpia Maria, si la condició es compleix, la conseqüència també ha de ser certa. Així doncs, segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria."

Això vol dir que la declaració de la Maria és falsa, perquè es compleix la condició (la planta està seca) però no la conseqüència (hi ha una regadora). Per tant, la realitat és que no hi ha cap regadora."
B7C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La planta no està seca. Hi ha una mànega al jardí. La Maria diu: ""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria?","No es pot saber.

La frase de la Maria és una condició: ""Si la planta està seca (A), hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria (B)"".

Quan la part del ""si"" d'una condició és falsa, no podem saber res sobre la part del ""aleshores"". La frase de la Maria només ens diu què passaria si la planta estigués seca, però com que no ho està, la seva afirmació no ens diu si hi ha o no una regadora a la prestatgeria."
B8T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La camisa del Jordi està arrugada i hi ha una planxa a l'armari. També hi ha una taula de planxar al balcó.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?","No, no es pot afirmar amb certesa només amb el que diu la Maria.

**Explicació:**

La frase de la Maria és una condicional: ""Si P, llavors Q"".
*   **P:** La camisa del Jordi està arrugada.
*   **Q:** Hi ha una planxa a l'armari.

La Maria només estableix una relació: en el cas que la camisa estigui arrugada (P), aleshores es compleix que hi ha una planxa a l'armari (Q).

Però la seva frase **no confirma que la camisa estigui realment arrugada**. Només diu què passaria si ho estigués. Com que no sabem si la condició (P) és certa, no podem assegurar que la conseqüència (Q) ho sigui.

**En resum:** Segons la lògica de la frase de la Maria, no podem concloure que hi hagi una planxa a l'armari, perquè ella no diu que la camisa estigui arrugada, sinó que ho posa com a condició."

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?","Sí, segons el que diu la Maria, hi ha una planxa a l'armari.

**Raonament:**

1.  L'afirmació de la Maria és una condicional: ""Si **P**, llavors **Q**"".
    *   **P (la condició):** ""La camisa del Jordi està arrugada"".
    *   **Q (la conseqüència):** ""Hi ha una planxa a l'armari"".

2.  El context ens diu que la condició **P** és certa: ""La camisa del Jordi està arrugada"".

3.  Si acceptem la regla de la Maria com a vàlida, i la seva condició (P) es compleix, la seva conseqüència (Q) també s'ha de complir.

**Nota important:** Tot i que segons la lògica de la Maria hi hauria una planxa, el context inicial ens diu explícitament que ""no hi ha cap planxa a l'armari"".

La frase de la Maria és una condició: ""Si la camisa està arrugada (A), aleshores hi ha una planxa a l'armari (B)"".

El que sabem és que la camisa del Jordi **no** té arrugues. Per tant, la condició (A) és falsa.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria?","No, no es pot afirmar amb certesa només basant-se en el que diu la Maria.

**Explicació:**

La frase de la Maria (""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"") és una condició. Això vol dir que la presència de llibres a l'estanteria depèn del fet que la Susanna vulgui llegir.

El que diu la Maria no confirma que la Susanna realment vol llegir, només estableix una relació entre els dos fets. Com que no sabem si la condició (""la Susanna vol llegir"") es compleix, no podem estar segurs que la conseqüència (""hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"") sigui certa.

La frase ""La Júlia no ha rebut cap càmera fotogràfica"" és un fet presentat com a cert. Això significa que, tot i que la condició que la Maria va establir (""si les guineus estan ballant"") es compleix, la promesa o predicció (""La Júlia rebrà una càmera fotogràfica"") no s'ha complert.

Només sabem que la Júlia no ha rebut la càmera *perquè les guineus estiguessin ballant*. Podria haver-la rebut per qualsevol altra raó, o potser no l'ha rebuda. La informació que tenim és insuficient per afirmar que ha rebut la càmera."

El text diu explícitament que ""L'Emma va de verd"". Tot i que la Maria va fer la predicció que si el temps era assolellat l'Emma aniria de morat, la realitat descrita en el context és que va anar de verd. Per tant, no és veritat que l'Emma vagi de morat."

B1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni ha fame e c'è della pizza in forno. C'è anche della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","Sì, è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  La frase di Maria è una condizione: **Se** Gianni ha fame (A), **allora** c'è della pizza in forno (B).
2.  Il contesto ci dice che la prima parte della condizione (A) è vera: ""Gianni ha fame"".
3.  Secondo le regole della logica (in particolare il *modus ponens*), se la condizione ""Se A, allora B"" è vera e la parte A è vera, allora anche la parte B deve essere vera.

Pertanto, basandosi su ciò che dice Maria e sul fatto che Gianni ha fame, si può concludere che è vero che c'è della pizza in forno."

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

    *   Gianni ha fame (la condizione del ""se"" è vera).
    *   Non c'è della pizza in forno (la conseguenza dell'""allora"" è falsa).
3.  **La conclusione:** L'affermazione di Maria è **falsa**. Perché? Perché la condizione (Gianni ha fame) si è avverata, ma la conseguenza (c'è della pizza) no.

In base ai fatti reali del contesto, quindi, la pizza in forno non c'è, e la frase di Maria si rivela essere una bugia o un errore."

1.  La condizione per sapere se c'è la pizza è che ""Gianni ha fame"".
2.  Il contesto ci dice che ""Gianni **non** ha fame"".

Poiché la condizione (la parte ""se..."") non è vera, l'affermazione di Maria non ci dice nulla sulla conclusione (la parte ""allora...""). La sua frase sarebbe vera sia se ci fosse la pizza, sia se non ci fosse.

In altre parole, Maria ci sta dicendo cosa succede *nel caso in cui* Gianni abbia fame, ma non ci sta dicendo cosa succede quando non ce l'ha. Quindi, non possiamo sapere se c'è della pizza in forno."
B2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo. C'è anche dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto.

La frase di Maria è una proposizione condizionale: ""Se A, allora B"".
*   **A (la condizione):** ""Nicoletta ha mal di testa""
*   **B (la conseguenza):** ""Ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo""

Dal contesto sappiamo che la condizione (A) è vera: Nicoletta ha effettivamente mal di testa.

In logica, se la condizione di una frase ""se... allora..."" è vera, allora anche la conseguenza deve essere vera. Poiché sappiamo che Nicoletta ha mal di testa, e Maria ha detto che *se* Nicoletta ha mal di testa *allora* ci sono delle aspirine, possiamo concludere che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo."
B2F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo. Non c'è nemmeno dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","No, non è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  L'affermazione di Maria è: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, allora ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"".
2.  Sappiamo dal contesto che la prima parte è vera: ""Nicoletta ha mal di testa"".
3.  Sappiamo anche dal contesto che la seconda parte è falsa: ""Non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo"".

In logica, una frase ""Se P, allora Q"" è considerata falsa quando la condizione ""P"" è vera, ma il risultato ""Q"" è falso.

Poiché Nicoletta ha davvero mal di testa (P è vero) ma non ci sono aspirine (Q è falso), l'affermazione di Maria è **falsa**. Pertanto, la realtà dei fatti è che non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo."
B2C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta non ha mal di testa. C'è dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","Non è possibile saperlo.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se A, allora B"".
*   **A** = ""Nicoletta ha mal di testa""
*   **B** = ""Ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo""

Noi sappiamo che **A è falsa** (Nicoletta non ha mal di testa).

In logica, quando la prima parte di una condizione (l'antecedente) è falsa, la condizione è sempre vera, ma non ci dice assolutamente nulla sulla verità o la falsità della seconda parte (il conseguente).

In altre parole, Maria ci ha detto cosa succederebbe *nel caso in cui* Nicoletta avesse mal di testa. Poiché questo caso non si verifica, la sua affermazione non ci permette di concludere nulla sulla presenza o l'assenza di aspirine sul tavolo. Potrebbero esserci come potrebbero non esserci.

B3T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e c'è dell'acqua in frigo. C'è anche del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","Sì, è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  Maria fa un'affermazione condizionale: ""**Se** Lucia ha sete, **allora** c'è dell'acqua in frigo"".
2.  Sappiamo dal contesto che la prima parte della condizione è vera: ""Lucia ha sete"".
3.  Quando la condizione del ""se"" è vera, anche la conseguenza del ""allora"" deve essere vera.

Quindi, dato che Lucia ha sete, in base alla frase di Maria, dobbiamo concludere che c'è dell'acqua in frigo."
B3F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e non c'è dell'acqua in frigo. Non c'è nemmeno del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","Sì.

**Spiegazione:**

La domanda chiede di basarsi *esclusivamente* su ciò che dice Maria.

1.  **La regola di Maria è:** ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"".
2.  **Il dato di fatto è:** ""Lucia ha sete"".

Applicando la logica, se la condizione (""Lucia ha sete"") è vera, allora anche la conseguenza (""c'è dell'acqua in frigo"") deve essere vera, secondo la regola enunciata da Maria.

Anche se il contesto iniziale dice il contrario, la risposta alla domanda ""In base a quello che dice Maria..."" è sì."
B3C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia non ha sete. C'è del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","Non si può sapere.

**Spiegazione:**

L'affermazione di Maria è una condizionale: ""Se P, allora Q"".
*   **P** = ""Lucia ha sete""
*   **Q** = ""c'è dell'acqua in frigo""

Noi sappiamo che **P è falso** (""Lucia non ha sete"").

In logica, quando la condizione (la parte ""se"") di un'affermazione è falsa, l'intera affermazione è considerata vera, ma non ci dice nulla sulla verità o la falsità della conseguenza (la parte ""allora"").

In parole semplici: Maria ci dice cosa accadrebbe *nel caso in cui* Lucia avesse sete. Poiché Lucia non ha sete, l'affermazione di Maria non ci dà alcuna informazione sulla presenza dell'acqua in frigo. L'acqua potrebbe esserci come potrebbe non esserci."
B4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. C'è anche un computer sul tavolo.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","No, non è possibile determinarlo basandosi solo sulle parole di Maria.

Ecco perché:

L'affermazione di Maria è una frase condizionale: ""**Se** il telefono di Pietro è scarico, **allora** c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"".

Questa frase stabilisce una relazione, ma non conferma i fatti. Maria ci sta dicendo cosa succederebbe *nel caso in cui* il telefono fosse scarico. Non ci sta dicendo che il telefono *è* scarico.

Per sapere con certezza che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto, ci dobbiamo basare sull'informazione data dal contesto iniziale (""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto""), non sulla sola ipotesi di Maria."
B4F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. Non c'è nemmeno un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","Sì, in base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  **La frase di Maria è una condizione:** ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico (A), allora c'è un caricatore nel cassetto (B)"".
2.  **Il contesto ci dice che la condizione (A) è vera:** ""Il telefono di Pietro è scarico"".
3.  **Applicando la logica:** Se la condizione ""A"" è vera, allora anche la conseguenza ""B"" deve essere vera, secondo la regola stabilita da Maria.

Quindi, seguendo il ragionamento di Maria, se il telefono è scarico (e lo è), deve esserci per forza un caricatore nel cassetto.

**Nota importante:** Questo risultato contraddice un'altra informazione data dal contesto (""Non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto""). Questo significa che la frase detta da Maria è **falsa**. Tuttavia, la domanda chiede specificamente di valutare la verità della conclusione **in base a quello che dice Maria**, e in base a quella logica, la conclusione è ""sì""."
B4C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è carico. C'è un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","No, non è detto.

L'affermazione di Maria è una condizione: ""Se A, allora B"".
*   **A** = ""il telefono di Pietro è scarico""
*   **B** = ""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto""

Il contesto ci dice che il telefono di Pietro è **carico**. Questo significa che la condizione **A è falsa**.

In logica, quando la prima parte di una frase condizionale (il ""se"") è falsa, l'intera affermazione è considerata vera, ma non ci dice assolutamente nulla sulla verità o la falsità della seconda parte (il ""allora"").

In altre parole, Maria ci sta dicendo cosa succede *se* il telefono fosse scarico. Poiché non lo è, la sua affermazione non ci permette di concludere nulla sulla presenza del caricatore. Il caricatore potrebbe essere nel cassetto, ma potrebbe anche non esserci. Non abbiamo abbastanza informazioni per saperlo."
B5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. C'è anche un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No, non è possibile esserne certi basandosi solo sulle parole di Maria.

**Spiegazione:**

Maria sta facendo un'affermazione condizionale: ""Se P, allora Q"".
*   **P** = ""il tempo è piovoso""
*   **Q** = ""c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli""

Questa affermazione ci garantisce che Q è vero **solo se** P è vero. Tuttavia, le parole di Maria non ci dicono se la condizione P (il tempo piovoso) sia effettivamente vera.

In altre parole, Maria non sta dicendo ""Sta piovendo"". Sta solo dicendo che *nel caso in cui* piova, allora ci sarà un ombrello. Se non piovesse, la sua affermazione sarebbe comunque vera, ma non potremmo sapere se c'è o meno l'ombrello.

Quindi, basandosi esclusivamente sulla sua frase, non possiamo concludere con certezza che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli."

Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No, non è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione:

1.  **Il contesto è la fonte della verità:** Il problema inizia stabilendo dei fatti. Uno di questi fatti è: ""**Non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli**"". Questa è la nostra realtà di partenza.
2.  **L'affermazione di Maria è una condizione:** Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". Questa è un'affermazione che può essere vera o falsa.
3.  **Verifichiamo l'affermazione di Maria:**
    *   La prima parte della condizione è vera: ""Il tempo è piovoso"".
    *   La seconda parte (la conseguenza) è falsa, perché sappiamo dal contesto che ""non c'è un ombrello"".

Poiché la condizione (""se piove"") è vera, ma la conseguenza (""allora c'è un ombrello"") è falsa, l'intera affermazione di Maria è **falsa**.

In conclusione, in base ai fatti del contesto, **non è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli**. Anzi, è vero il contrario."
B5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è sereno. C'è un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No, non è vero.

La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"".

Dato che il tempo è sereno (e quindi non piovoso), la condizione non si verifica. L'affermazione di Maria ci dice solo cosa accadrebbe *se* piovesse, non ci dice nulla sulla situazione attuale.

Pertanto, in base alle informazioni fornite, non possiamo sapere se c'è un ombrello o meno."

Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","Sì, è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  Maria fa un'affermazione condizionale: ""Se **la gomma della macchina è a terra** (condizione P), allora **c'è una pompa in garage** (conseguenza Q)"".
2.  Il contesto ci conferma che la condizione P è vera (""La gomma della macchina è a terra"").
3.  In una frase ""Se P, allora Q"", se la condizione P è vera, anche la conseguenza Q deve essere vera perché l'intera affermazione sia corretta.

Quindi, poiché la gomma è effettivamente a terra, in base a quello che dice Maria, dobbiamo concludere che è vero che c'è una pompa in garage."

2.  Il contesto ci conferma che la condizione A è vera: ""La gomma della macchina è a terra"".
3.  Secondo la logica dell'affermazione di Maria, se la condizione A è vera, anche la conseguenza B deve essere vera.

Quindi, seguendo il ragionamento di Maria, la conclusione obbligata è che c'è una pompa in garage.

**Nota importante:** La prima frase del contesto (""...non c'è nessuna pompa in garage"") ci dice che nella realtà Maria sta dicendo il falso. Tuttavia, la domanda non chiede se Maria abbia ragione, ma cosa si deduce *dalle sue parole*. In base a quelle parole, la conclusione è che la pompa c'è."
B6C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è gonfia. C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No, non è detto.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se la gomma è a terra, *allora* c'è una pompa"".

Tuttavia, il contesto ci dice che ""la gomma della macchina è gonfia"". Dato che la condizione (la gomma a terra) non si verifica, la frase di Maria non ci dà alcuna informazione sulla presenza o l'assenza della pompa.

La pompa potrebbe esserci o no, ma non possiamo saperlo basandoci solo sulle parole di Maria."
B7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. C'è anche un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No, non è possibile stabilirlo con certezza basandosi solo sulle parole di Maria.

**Spiegazione:**

Maria sta facendo un'affermazione condizionale. La sua frase ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"" stabilisce una condizione, ma non ci dice se quella condizione è vera.

*   **Se la pianta è secca**, allora sì, possiamo concludere che c'è un annaffiatoio.
*   **Se la pianta non è secca**, l'affermazione di Maria è comunque vera, ma non ci dice nulla sulla presenza o meno dell'annaffiatoio.

Dato che dalle parole di Maria non sappiamo se la pianta sia effettivamente secca, non possiamo essere sicuri che ci sia un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale."
B7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No, non è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  **Il contesto dice:** ""non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". Questa è un'affermazione di fatto che dobbiamo considerare vera.
2.  **L'affermazione di Maria è:** ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". Questa è una condizione (un'implicazione logica).
3.  **Analizziamo la condizione di Maria:**
    *   La prima parte (""la pianta è secca"") è vera, come confermato dal contesto.
    *   La seconda parte (""c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"") è falsa, come confermato dal contesto.

In logica, una condizione ""Se A, allora B"" è falsa esattamente quando A è vera e B è falsa. Poiché questo è il caso, l'affermazione di Maria è **falsa**.

Quindi, in base a tutto ciò che sappiamo (inclusa la falsa affermazione di Maria), la conclusione corretta è che **non c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale**."
B7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è rigogliosa. C'è un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No.

**Spiegazione:**

Quello che dice Maria è una condizione: ""Se la pianta è secca, *allora* c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"".

Tuttavia, il contesto ci dice che ""la pianta è rigogliosa"", il che significa che **non è secca**.

Poiché la condizione (""la pianta è secca"") non è vera, non possiamo concludere nulla sulla presenza dell'annaffiatoio basandoci solo sulle parole di Maria. L'annaffiatoio potrebbe esserci o no, ma la sua affermazione non ci aiuta a saperlo."
B8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. C'è anche un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","Sì, è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione:

La frase di Maria è una condizione logica: **""Se A è vero, allora B è vero""**.

*   **A** = ""La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata"".
*   **B** = ""C'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"".

Il contesto ci dice che la condizione **A è vera** (la camicia è stropicciata).

Secondo la logica della frase di Maria, se la condizione A è vera, allora anche la conseguenza B deve essere vera. Pertanto, in base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio."
B8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non c'è nemmeno un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  **L'affermazione di Maria:** ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". Questa è una frase condizionale (se A, allora B).
2.  **I fatti del contesto:**
    *   Fatto A: ""La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata"" (questo è VERO).
    *   Fatto B: ""Non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"" (questo significa che la frase ""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"" è FALSA).
3.  **La conclusione:** Poiché la prima parte della frase di Maria è vera, ma la seconda parte è falsa, l'intera affermazione di Maria è falsa.

Quindi, in base ai fatti presentati, non è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Anzi, è falso."
B8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stirata. C'è un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No, non è detto.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

Quello che dice Maria è una frase condizionale: ""Se A, allora B"".
*   **A** = ""la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata""
*   **B** = ""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio""

Il contesto ci dice che la camicia di Giorgio è **stirata**. Questo significa che la condizione **A è falsa**.

In logica, se la condizione del ""se"" (A) è falsa, la frase ""Se A, allora B"" è sempre vera, ma non ci dice nulla sulla verità o la falsità di B.

In altre parole, Maria ci dice cosa succederebbe *se* la camicia fosse stropicciata, ma non ci dice cosa succede *dato che* la camicia è stirata. Il ferro da stiro potrebbe essere nell'armadio, ma potrebbe anche essere altrove (forse è stato usato sulla balcone e non è ancora stato riposto).

Pertanto, in base solo a quello che dice Maria, **non possiamo concludere con certezza che ci sia un ferro da stiro nell'armadio.**"
B9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. C'è anche un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","Sì, è vero.

Il contesto afferma chiaramente che ""ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". La frase di Maria, ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"", conferma questa informazione, dato che sappiamo che Susanna vuole leggere."
B9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e non ci sono libri sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","No, non è possibile dirlo con certezza basandosi solo sulle parole di Maria.

Ecco la spiegazione:

La frase di Maria è una proposizione condizionale: ""Se P, allora Q"".
*   **P** = ""Susanna vuole leggere""
*   **Q** = ""ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale""

Maria sta affermando che nel caso in cui la condizione P sia vera, anche Q sarà vera. Tuttavia, la sua frase non ci dice se la condizione P (che Susanna voglia leggere) sia effettivamente verificata.

*   **Se Susanna vuole leggere**, allora secondo Maria ci sono dei libri.
*   **Se Susanna non vuole leggere**, la frase di Maria non ci dà alcuna informazione sui libri. Potrebbero esserci o non esserci, la sua condizione non si applica.

Quindi, dalle sole parole di Maria non possiamo concludere con certezza che ci siano dei libri sullo scaffale.

**Nota:** Se consideriamo l'intero contesto fornito all'inizio (""non ci sono libri sullo scaffale""), allora sappiamo che l'affermazione di Maria è falsa. Ma la domanda chiede specificamente di basarsi solo su quello che dice Maria, e in quel caso la sua frase non è sufficiente per affermare la presenza dei libri."
B9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna non vuole leggere. C'è un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","Sì.

**Spiegazione:**

Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, **ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale**"".

La parte ""ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"" è affermata da Maria come un fatto. La prima parte della frase (""Se Susanna vuole leggere..."") introduce solo una condizione, ma non cambia la verità della seconda parte.

Anche se Susanna non vuole leggere (e quindi la condizione non si verifica), Maria sta comunque dicendo che i libri esistono e si trovano lì. Quindi, in base alle sue parole, possiamo concludere che è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale."

In base al contesto, l'acqua non è più richiesta delle bibite gassate. Il testo afferma infatti che ""molti scelgono le bibite gassate"", il che suggerisce che, nonostante l'acqua sia più sana, le bibite siano la scelta preferita da un numero maggiore di persone e quindi più richieste.

Poiché la condizione ""il parco giochi è vuoto"" non è soddisfatta, la dichiarazione di Maria non ci permette di concludere nulla. Angela potrebbe essersi fatta un selfie per un altro motivo, oppure non esserselo fatto. Non abbiamo abbastanza informazioni per dirlo con certezza."
S7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","Sì, è vero.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è una promessa condizionata:
*   **Condizione:** ""Se Paolo taglia il prato...""
*   **Conseguenza:** ""...riceverà 50 euro.""

Il contesto ci dice che ""il prato è stato tagliato"". Questo significa che la condizione posta da Maria è stata soddisfatta. Di conseguenza, in base a quanto detto da lei, la conseguenza deve verificarsi.

Quindi, Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro."
S7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","No, non è vero.

Il testo afferma esplicitamente: ""Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro"".

Anche se la condizione di Maria (""Se Paolo taglia il prato..."") è stata soddisfatta, dato che il prato è stato tagliato, la promessa non è stata mantenuta e Paolo non ha ricevuto i soldi."
S7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato non è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori devono ancora essere annaffiati.  Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","No.

Maria ha stabilito una condizione precisa: Paolo riceverà i 50 euro *se* taglia il prato. Dato che il contesto afferma che ""il prato non è stato tagliato"", la condizione per il pagamento non è stata soddisfatta. Pertanto, in base alle parole di Maria, non possiamo concludere che Paolo abbia ricevuto i soldi."
S8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","Non possiamo esserne certi.

Ecco la spiegazione:

1.  Maria ha detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio **leggerà** un libro"". Il verbo ""leggerà"" è al tempo futuro.
2.  Sappiamo che la condizione è vera (""il cane sta giocando"").
3.  Quindi, possiamo concludere che Antonio **leggerà** un libro (l'azione accadrà in futuro).

Tuttavia, la domanda chiede se Antonio **ha letto** un libro (passato prossimo). Il testo non ci dice se l'azione è già stata completata. Sappiamo solo che avverrà.

In sintesi: sappiamo che Antonio **leggerà** un libro, ma non possiamo affermare con certezza che **ha già letto** un libro."
S8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Antonio non ha letto nessun libro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","No, non è vero.

Il testo afferma esplicitamente: ""Antonio non ha letto nessun libro"".

Anche se il cane sta giocando (la condizione della frase di Maria è soddisfatta), la realtà dei fatti, come riportato nel contesto, è che Antonio non ha letto un libro. Questo significa che la previsione di Maria si è rivelata falsa."
S8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane non sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto sta dormendo. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","No, non è detto. Non possiamo sapere con certezza se Antonio ha letto un libro.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se il cane sta giocando (A), allora Antonio leggerà un libro (B)"".

Noi sappiamo che la condizione (A) è falsa, perché il cane non sta giocando.

Tuttavia, il fatto che la condizione sia falsa non ci dice nulla sulla conseguenza (B). Antonio potrebbe aver letto un libro lo stesso per un altro motivo, oppure potrebbe non averlo letto. L'affermazione di Maria non copre questo caso."
S9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","Sì, è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

1.  Maria ha stabilito una condizione: **""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle""**.
2.  Il contesto ci dice che la condizione è vera: **""Il frigorifero è vuoto""**.
3.  Secondo la logica, se la condizione di una frase ""se... allora..."" è vera, anche la conseguenza deve essere considerata vera.

Quindi, dato che il frigorifero è vuoto, la promessa di Maria si realizza e Anna ha portato delle ciambelle.

Il fatto che il forno sia rotto è un'informazione aggiuntiva che non influisce sulla conclusione, perché la frase di Maria dipendeva solo dallo stato del frigorifero."
S9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è vero.

Ecco la spiegazione basata sul contesto:

1.  **La condizione di Maria:** Maria ha detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"".
2.  **La condizione è vera:** Il contesto ci conferma che ""il frigorifero è vuoto"".
3.  **La conseguenza non è avvenuta:** Il contesto afferma chiaramente che ""Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle"".

Quindi, anche se la condizione posta da Maria si è verificata (il frigorifero era vuoto), la promessa non è stata mantenuta. Di conseguenza, è falso che Anna abbia portato delle ciambelle."
S9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è pieno. Inoltre, il forno è acceso. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è vero. Anzi, non possiamo saperlo con certezza.

Ecco perché:

1.  Maria ha stabilito una condizione: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"".
2.  La situazione reale è che ""il frigorifero è pieno"".

Poiché la condizione (il frigorifero vuoto) non si è verificata, non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione. Anna potrebbe aver portato le ciambelle per un altro motivo, oppure potrebbe non averle portate affatto.

In base a quello che dice Maria, sappiamo solo cosa sarebbe successo *se* il frigorifero fosse stato vuoto, non cosa è successo dato che era pieno."
B1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y hay pizza en el horno. También hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","Sí, es verdad que hay pizza en el horno.

**Razonamiento:**

1.  **La frase de María es una condicional:** ""Si Juan tiene hambre (condición), hay pizza en el horno (consecuencia)"".
2.  **El contexto nos confirma que la condición es cierta:** ""Juan tiene hambre"".
3.  **En lógica, si la condición de una frase ""si... entonces..."" es verdadera, la consecuencia también debe ser verdadera.**

Dado que Juan tiene hambre, según la lógica de la propia afirmación de María, se cumple que hay pizza en el horno."
B1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y no hay pizza en el horno. Tampoco hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","Sí, según lo que dice María, es verdad que hay pizza en el horno.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La afirmación de María es una condicional:** ""Si Juan tiene hambre (A), entonces hay pizza en el horno (B)"".
2.  **El contexto nos dice que la primera parte (A) es cierta:** ""Juan tiene hambre"".
3.  **Según la lógica de la afirmación de María,** si la condición ""Juan tiene hambre"" se cumple, entonces la consecuencia ""hay pizza en el horno"" también debe cumplirse.

Por lo tanto, si aceptamos como regla lo que dice María, la conclusión lógica es que hay pizza en el horno.

**Aclaración importante:** El contexto inicial también nos dice que ""no hay pizza en el horno"". Esto significa que la afirmación de María es **falsa**. Sin embargo, la pregunta no es si María dice la verdad, sino qué se deduce *de lo que ella dice*. Según su propia lógica, la respuesta es que sí hay pizza."
B1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan no tiene hambre. Hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No se puede saber si hay pizza en el horno.

**Explicación:**

La declaración de María es una condicional: ""Si **A** ocurre, entonces **B** ocurre"".
*   **A:** Juan tiene hambre.
*   **B:** Hay pizza en el horno.

Lo que dice María solo nos garantiza que **B** es verdad si **A** es verdad.

Sin embargo, el contexto nos dice que **A es falsa** (""Juan no tiene hambre"").

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" es falsa, la declaración no nos dice nada sobre la consecuencia. Podría haber pizza o no, y en ambos casos, lo que dijo María seguiría siendo técnicamente cierto.

*   **Caso 1:** No hay pizza en el horno. La frase ""Si Juan tuviera hambre, habría pizza"" sigue siendo cierta porque la primera parte (que Juan tenga hambre) no es verdad.
*   **Caso 2:** Sí hay pizza en el horno. La frase también es cierta.

Por lo tanto, con la información proporcionada, **no podemos afirmar que haya pizza en el horno**. La mención de la pasta en la nevera es irrelevante para esta conclusión."
B2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","Sí, es verdad.

**Explicación:**

1.  María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza (condición), hay aspirinas sobre la mesa (consecuencia)"".
2.  El contexto nos confirma que la condición es cierta: ""A Noelia le duele la cabeza"".
3.  Según la lógica de la afirmación de María, si la condición se cumple, la consecuencia también debe cumplirse.

Por lo tanto, si aceptamos lo que dice María como cierto, y sabemos que a Noelia le duele la cabeza, entonces necesariamente debe haber aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no es verdad que haya aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **El contexto es la verdad:** El texto establece como un hecho que ""no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"".
2.  **La afirmación de María es una condicional:** María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza (condición), hay aspirinas sobre la mesa (consecuencia)"".
3.  **Evaluamos la afirmación de María:**
    *   La condición se cumple: ""A Noelia le duele la cabeza"".
    *   La consecuencia no se cumple: ""no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"".

Cuando en una declaración ""Si A, entonces B"", la parte A es cierta pero la parte B es falsa, toda la declaración es **falsa**.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta directa a tu pregunta es **No**, no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Y esto demuestra que lo que dijo María es incorrecto."
B2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condicional: ""Si **P** (a Noelia le duele la cabeza), entonces **Q** (hay aspirinas sobre la mesa)"".

El contexto nos dice que **P es falso** (""A Noelia no le duele la cabeza"").

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" es falsa, la afirmación completa es lógicamente cierta, pero no nos da ninguna información sobre la conclusión (Q). En otras palabras, como la premisa no se cumple, no podemos saber si la consecuencia es cierta o no.

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María, no podemos afirmar ni negar que haya aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y hay agua en la nevera. También hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí.

**Explicación:**

La afirmación de María es una condicional: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"".

1.  **La condición:** ""Lucía tiene sed"". El contexto nos dice que esto es verdad.
2.  **La consecuencia:** ""hay agua en la nevera"".

Según la lógica de la afirmación de María, si la condición es cierta, la consecuencia también debe ser cierta. Como sabemos que Lucía tiene sed, entonces, según lo que dice María, tiene que haber agua en la nevera."
B3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. Tampoco hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, según la lógica de la afirmación de María, debe haber agua en la nevera.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La afirmación de María es una condicional:** ""Si Lucía tiene sed (condición A), entonces hay agua en la nevera (consecuencia B)"".
2.  **El contexto nos dice que la condición A es verdad:** ""Lucía tiene sed"".
3.  **La conclusión lógica es:** Si la condición se cumple (Lucía tiene sed), la consecuencia también debe cumplirse (hay agua en la nevera), según la regla que estableció María.

Por lo tanto, si nos basamos estrictamente en lo que dice María, la respuesta es que **sí hay agua en la nevera**.

---

**Aclaración importante:**

El contexto también nos dice explícitamente que ""no hay agua en la nevera"". Esto crea una contradicción, lo que significa que la afirmación de María es **falsa**. María está equivocada o miente.

La pregunta no es si María dice la verdad, sino qué se deduce *de su declaración*. Según su declaración, debería haber agua."
B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, es verdad.

**Explicación:**

1.  María establece una condición: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"".
2.  El contexto nos dice que la primera parte de esa condición es cierta: ""Lucía tiene sed"".
3.  En lógica, si se cumple la condición de un ""si..., entonces..."", la consecuencia también se debe cumplir.

Por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, si Lucía tiene sed (y lo tiene), entonces debe haber agua en la nevera. El zumo de manzana es información irrelevante para esta conclusión."

**Explicación:**

1.  María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería (condición A), hay un cargador en el cajón (consecuencia B)"".
2.  El contexto nos confirma que la **condición A es cierta**: ""El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería"".
3.  En lógica, si la condición de un enunciado ""si... entonces..."" es verdadera, la consecuencia también debe ser verdadera para que todo el enunciado sea correcto.

Por lo tanto, si aceptamos lo que dice María como cierto, y sabemos que la condición se cumple, entonces la consecuencia (""hay un cargador en el cajón"") también debe ser cierta."

María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"".

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La declaración de María:** ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería (condición A), hay un cargador en el cajón (consecuencia B)"".
2.  **Los hechos del contexto:**
    *   La condición A es **verdadera**: El móvil de Pedro SÍ se ha quedado sin batería.

3.  **La conclusión lógica:** Cuando en una declaración ""si... entonces..."" la condición (la parte del ""si"") es verdadera, pero la consecuencia (la parte del ""entonces"") es falsa, la declaración completa es **falsa**.

Por lo tanto, lo que dice María es falso. La realidad, según el contexto, es que no hay un cargador en el cajón."
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

Lo que dice María es una frase condicional: ""Si [condición], entonces [consecuencia]"".

1.  **La condición:** ""el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería"".
2.  **La consecuencia:** ""hay un cargador en el cajón"".

El contexto nos dice que la condición es **falsa** (""El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena"").

Cuando la parte del ""si"" de una frase es falsa, la declaración en sí es lógicamente cierta, pero no nos da ninguna información sobre si la parte del ""entonces"" es cierta o falsa.

En resumen, como el móvil no se ha quedado sin batería, la declaración de María no se ""activa"". Por lo tanto, no podemos saber si hay o no un cargador en el cajón basándonos únicamente en lo que ella dijo."

**Razonamiento:**

1.  María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso (condición A), hay un paraguas en el paragüero (consecuencia B)"".
2.  El contexto nos confirma que la **condición A es cierta**: ""El tiempo está lluvioso"".
3.  Según la lógica de la afirmación de María, si la condición se cumple, la consecuencia también debe ser cierta.

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María, sí es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero."
B5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y no hay paraguas en el paragüero. Tampoco hay ningún chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No, no es verdad que haya un paraguas en el paragüero.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **El contexto es la realidad:** El texto establece como un hecho que ""no hay paraguas en el paragüero"". Esa es la verdad del escenario.
2.  **La afirmación de María es una condicional:** María dice ""Si P, entonces Q"".

    *   **Q (la consecuencia):** ""hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". (Esto es falso según el contexto).
3.  **La afirmación de María es falsa:** Para que una afirmación ""Si P, entonces Q"" sea verdadera, no puede darse el caso de que P sea verdadero y Q sea falso. En este caso, sí llueve (P es verdad) pero no hay paraguas (Q es falso), por lo que la declaración de María es incorrecta.

En resumen: La realidad es que **no hay un paraguas**, y la declaración de María, que afirma que sí lo habría si lloviera, resulta ser **falsa**."

La afirmación de María es una condicional: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso (condición), entonces hay un paraguas en el paragüero (consecuencia)"".

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condicional: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada (condición A), entonces hay una bomba de aire en el garaje (consecuencia B)"".

Esto nos dice lo que pasaría *si* la rueda estuviera pinchada, pero no nos confirma que la rueda *está* pinchada. Si la rueda no lo estuviera, la afirmación de María seguiría siendo cierta, pero no podríamos saber si hay o no una bomba.

Para poder afirmar que hay una bomba, necesitaríamos dos cosas:
1.  Que la rueda esté pinchada (lo cual nos dice el contexto inicial).
2.  Que la declaración de María sea verdad.

1.  El contexto nos confirma que la primera parte de la condición es verdadera: ""La rueda del coche está pinchada"".
2.  Si aceptamos como regla lo que dice María, y la condición se cumple, entonces la consecuencia debe ser cierta.
3.  Por lo tanto, siguiendo la lógica de María, si la rueda está pinchada (que lo está), entonces debe haber una bomba de aire en el garaje.

**Aclaración importante:** Esto no significa que María tenga razón. De hecho, el contexto nos dice explícitamente que **no hay ninguna bomba**, lo que demuestra que la afirmación de María es **falsa**. Sin embargo, la pregunta es qué se deduce de sus palabras, y según su razonamiento, la conclusión es que sí hay una bomba."
B6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está inflada. Hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada.

**Explicación:**

Lo que dice María es una declaración condicional: ""Si **la rueda está pinchada**, entonces **hay una bomba en el garaje**"".

El contexto nos dice que la condición (""la rueda está pinchada"") es **falsa**, porque la rueda está inflada.

Cuando la condición de un ""si..."" no se cumple, la declaración no nos da ninguna información sobre la segunda parte. La bomba puede estar allí o no, y en ambos casos, lo que dijo María no sería una mentira.

En resumen: Como la rueda no está pinchada, la ""promesa"" de María de que hay una bomba nunca se activa. Por lo tanto, no podemos saber si hay o no una bomba en el garaje basándonos solo en su frase."

1.  La afirmación de María es una condicional: ""Si **la camisa de Jorge está arrugada** (condición A), entonces **hay una plancha en el armario** (condición B)"".
2.  El contexto nos confirma que la condición A es cierta: ""La camisa de Jorge está arrugada"".
3.  Según las reglas de la lógica, si la primera parte de una condicional (el ""si"") es verdadera, entonces la segunda parte (el ""entonces"") también debe ser verdadera para que toda la afirmación sea cierta.

La declaración de María es una condicional: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"".

Esto solo nos dice qué pasaría **si la camisa estuviera arrugada**. Sin embargo, el contexto nos dice que ""la camisa de Jorge está planchada"", lo que significa que la condición (que esté arrugada) no se cumple.

*   **Si Susana no quiere leer**, la frase de María no nos da ninguna información sobre si hay libros o no. Podría haberlos o no.

Como no sabemos si se cumple la condición (""Susana quiere leer""), no podemos afirmar con seguridad que sea verdad que hay libros en la estantería basándonos únicamente en lo que dice María."
B9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y no hay libros en la estantería. Tampoco hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No, no es verdad.

Analicemos la lógica:

1.  **La afirmación de María es:** ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Esto es un enunciado condicional (Si A, entonces B).
2.  **El contexto nos dice:**
    *   **A) ""Susana quiere leer""** es VERDADERO.
    *   **B) ""Hay libros en la estantería""** es FALSO (porque el contexto dice explícitamente ""no hay libros en la estantería"").

En lógica, una afirmación condicional ""Si A, entonces B"" solo es **falsa** cuando la primera parte (A) es verdadera y la segunda parte (B) es falsa.

Como este es exactamente el caso, la declaración de María es **falsa**. Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María y la información que tenemos, no es verdad que haya libros en la estantería."
B9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana no quiere leer. Hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

Lo que dice María es una condición: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"".

El contexto nos dice que ""Susana no quiere leer"". Como la condición (que Susana quiera leer) no se cumple, la frase de María no nos dice si los libros están ahí o no. Solo nos lo garantiza en el caso de que ella quisiera leer.

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María, no podemos afirmar que sea verdad que hay libros en la estantería."

F3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿el agua tiene más demanda que los refrescos?","No, según el contexto, el agua no tiene más demanda que los refrescos.

El texto indica claramente que ""mucha gente prefiere los refrescos"", lo que sugiere que la demanda de refrescos es mayor que la del agua, a pesar de que el agua sea más saludable. La información de que ""hay agua en el ordenador"" no es relevante para responder a la pregunta."
F4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más. Hay brócoli en el horno. En este contexto, ¿el brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis?","Sí.

El contexto establece que ""la gente los compra más"". Que un producto se adquiera en mayor cantidad es un indicador directo de que es más popular, especialmente cuando se destaca que esto sucede ""aunque sean más caros""."
F6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más. Hay plátanos en la cesta. En este contexto, ¿los kiwis son más populares que los platanos?","No. Según el contexto, los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis, porque el texto afirma que ""la gente los compra más""."

F8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque leer libros sea más educativo que ver la televisión, mucha gente ve la televisión. Hay un libro en la estantería. En este contexto, ¿más personas ven la televisión de las que leen libros? ","Sí, el contexto lo sugiere.

La frase clave es ""**mucha gente ve la televisión**"". Aunque no especifica cuántas personas leen libros, el énfasis en que ""mucha gente"" ve la tele implica que es una actividad muy extendida, más que el acto de leer, del cual no se menciona su popularidad."

S1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","Sí, es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.

**Razonamiento:**

1.  **La condición de María:** María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Esto establece una condición y una consecuencia.
2.  **Se cumple la condición:** El contexto nos dice explícitamente que «El loro está en la jaula».
3.  **La consecuencia se cumple:** Dado que la condición se cumple, la consecuencia que María estableció también debe cumplirse.

Por lo tanto, según la lógica de la afirmación de María, Tomás trajo pizza. (La información sobre el perro en la caseta es irrelevante para esta conclusión)."
S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza"".
2.  **El hecho 1:** El loro sí está en la jaula. (La condición se cumple).
3.  **El hecho 2:** Tomás no trajo pizza. (El resultado no se cumple).

Como la condición se cumplió pero el resultado no, lo que dijo María resultó ser falso. Por lo tanto, es falso que Tomás trajera pizza."
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no es verdad que se pueda afirmar que Tomás trajo pizza. De hecho, **no se puede saber** si trajo pizza o no.

Aquí está la explicación lógica:

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza"". Esto solo nos dice lo que sucedería *si* el loro estuviera en la jaula.
2.  **La realidad:** ""El loro no está en la jaula"".
3.  **La conclusión:** Como la condición (el loro en la jaula) no se cumplió, la promesa de María no se activa. Su declaración no nos dice nada sobre lo que sucede cuando el loro no está en la jaula.

Tomás pudo haber traído pizza por otro motivo, o pudo no haberla traído. La única cosa que sabemos con certeza es que no lo hizo *porque* el loro estuviera en la jaula.

**Analogía:** Si tu madre te dice: ""Si sacas un 10 en el examen, te llevo al cine"", y tú sacas un 8, ¿significa eso que tu madre no te llevará al cine? No. Quizás te lleve de todas formas por otra razón, o quizás no. La promesa solo se aplicaba si sacabas un 10."
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Sí, según la lógica de lo que dijo María, es verdad.

**Explicación:**

María estableció una condición: ""Si te comes el brócoli (condición), Marcos te dará un caramelo (consecuencia)"".

Dado que tú cumpliste la condición (te comiste el brócoli), la consecuencia lógica es que Marcos te dio el caramelo. El hecho de que también te hayas comido la pasta no afecta a la promesa que se hizo sobre el brócoli."
S2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. Marcos no te dio un caramelo. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no es verdad.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"".
2.  **Tu acción:** Te comiste el brócoli.
3.  **La consecuencia esperada:** Según la regla de María, Marcos debería haberte dado un caramelo.
4.  **La realidad:** El contexto dice explícitamente: ""Marcos no te dio un caramelo"".

Aunque cumpliste la condición que María estableció, la promesa no se cumplió. Por lo tanto, es falso que Marcos te diera un caramelo."
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no es verdad.

**Explicación:**

María estableció una condición: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"".

El contexto dice claramente: ""No te has comido el brócoli"".

Como no se cumplió la condición (comerse el brócoli), no hay ninguna razón, basándose en lo que dijo María, para afirmar que Marcos te diera un caramelo. De hecho, la lógica de la promesa implica lo contrario."
S3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No, según el contexto no se puede afirmar que Susana recibió una cámara.

La información que nos da María es: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Como los zorros están bailando, la conclusión lógica es que fue **Irene**, y no Susana, quien recibió la cámara. El nombre de Susana no aparece en el texto."
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?","No.

El contexto establece de manera directa y explícita: ""**Irene no recibió una cámara**"".

La información sobre los zorros bailando y lo que María dijo sobre Susana es irrelevante para determinar si Irene recibió una cámara."
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No se puede saber si es verdad o no.

Aquí está el porqué:

1.  **La condición no se cumple:** María dijo: ""**Si** los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". El texto establece que ""Los zorros **no** están bailando"". Como la condición no se cumple, la promesa de María no se activa, por lo que no sabemos si Irene recibió o no una cámara.
2.  **La persona es diferente:** La pregunta es sobre **Susana**, pero la declaración de María habla de **Irene**. No hay ninguna información en el texto sobre Susana.

En resumen, el texto no da ninguna pista sobre si Susana recibió una cámara."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí, es verdad.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La regla de María:** ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Esto establece una condición y un resultado.
2.  **La condición se cumple:** El contexto dice que ""La televisión está encendida"".
3.  **La conclusión:** Dado que la condición se cumplió, el resultado que María predijo también debe ocurrir.

Por lo tanto, según lo que dijo María, Mateo hizo galletas. (La información sobre la radio es irrelevante para esta conclusión)."
S4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. Mateo no hizo galletas. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No.

De hecho, lo que dijo María resultó ser falso. La lógica es la siguiente:

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si la televisión está encendida..."".
2.  **El resultado prometido por María:** ""...Mateo hará galletas"".

Según el contexto:
*   La televisión sí está encendida (la condición se cumplió).
*   Mateo no hizo galletas (el resultado no ocurrió).

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" se cumple, pero el resultado no, la afirmación completa es falsa. Por lo tanto, no es verdad que Mateo hiciera galletas."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No se puede saber si Mateo hizo galletas.

**Explicación:**

La declaración de María es una condicional: ""Si la televisión está encendida (condición), entonces Mateo hará galletas (consecuencia)"".

El contexto nos dice que la condición no se cumplió, ya que ""la televisión está apagada"".

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" no se cumple, no podemos sacar ninguna conclusión sobre la consecuencia. Mateo pudo haber hecho galletas por otra razón, o pudo no haberlas hecho. La información que tenemos es insuficiente para afirmar o negar que hizo galletas."
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Sí.

**Explicación:**

1.  **La condición:** El contexto establece que ""el tiempo está soleado"".
2.  **La regla:** María dijo: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".
3.  **La conclusión:** Como la condición (tiempo soleado) se cumple, la consecuencia (Emma va a ir de morado) también debe cumplirse, según la regla de María.

Por lo tanto, basándonos en lo que dijo María, es verdad que Emma fue de morado."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No.

Según María, si el tiempo estaba soleado, Emma iría de morado. El contexto confirma que el tiempo estaba soleado, pero también dice que Emma fue de verde. Por lo tanto, la afirmación de que Emma fue de morado es falsa, y lo que María dijo no se cumplió."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, no es verdad que se pueda afirmar que Emma fue de morado.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condicional: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".

1.  **La condición:** ""el tiempo está soleado"".
2.  **La realidad:** ""el tiempo está lluvioso"".

Como la condición (tiempo soleado) no se cumplió, la afirmación de María no nos dice nada sobre lo que hizo Emma. No podemos saber si fue o no de morado. El hecho de que no fuera soleado no implica que ella *no* fuera de morado, simplemente que la regla de María no se activó.

Por lo tanto, con la información que tenemos, no podemos afirmar que Emma fue de morado."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí, es verdad.

**Explicación:**

La lógica se basa en lo que dijo María:

1.  **La condición:** ""Si el parque infantil está vacío...""
2.  **La consecuencia:** ""...Júlia se hará un selfie.""

El contexto nos confirma que la primera parte de la condición es cierta: ""El parque infantil está vacío"".

Según las reglas de la lógica, si se cumple la condición ""si"", entonces la consecuencia ""entonces"" también debe cumplirse.

Por lo tanto, si el parque está vacío (y lo está), Júlia se hizo un selfie. La información sobre las calles tranquilas es un dato extra que no cambia esta conclusión."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No, no es verdad.

**Explicación:**

1.  **La condición de María:** María estableció una regla: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".
2.  **Los hechos del contexto:**
    *   El parque infantil SÍ está vacío (la condición se cumple).
    *   Júlia NO se hizo ningún selfie (el resultado no se cumple).
3.  **Conclusión:** Como la condición era cierta pero el resultado fue falso, la afirmación de María resultó ser incorrecta en esta situación. Por lo tanto, es verdad que **Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie**."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

La condición que puso María fue: ""**Si** el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".

El contexto nos dice que el parque está **lleno**, es decir, que la condición no se cumplió.

Como la condición no se cumplió, la promesa de María no se activa. Esto no nos dice nada sobre si Júlia se hizo un selfie o no por otro motivo. Simplemente, no podemos afirmarlo con la información que tenemos."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No, no se puede afirmar que sea verdad.

**Explicación:**

El texto nos dice dos cosas:
1.  **El césped ha sido cortado.** (La condición de la promesa se ha cumplido).
2.  **María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"".** (María hizo una promesa).

Sin embargo, el texto **no confirma que María haya cumplido su promesa**. El hecho de que la condición se cumpla (el césped está cortado) no garantiza que la consecuencia (recibir 50 euros) también se haya cumplido.

Además, hay otra ambigüedad: la promesa era ""Si **Pablo** corta el césped..."", pero el texto solo dice ""El césped ha sido cortado"". No sabemos con certeza si fue Pablo quien lo hizo.

Para poder afirmar que Pablo recibió los 50 euros, necesitaríamos una frase como: ""María le pagó a Pablo"" o ""María cumplió su palabra""."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No.

**Explicación:**

El contexto dice que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero **no especifica que haya sido Pablo quien lo cortó**. Podría haberlo hecho otra persona (un jardinero, María, un vecino, etc.).

La promesa de María era: ""**Si Pablo corta el césped**, recibirá 50 euros"". Como no tenemos la certeza de que Pablo fuera el que realizó la acción, no podemos afirmar que haya recibido el dinero."
S7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped no ha sido cortado. Además, las flores no han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María establece una condición: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"".

El contexto nos dice que ""El césped no ha sido cortado"".

Como la condición (cortar el césped) no se cumplió, la promesa de María no se activa. Su declaración solo nos dice qué pasaría *si* Pablo hubiera cortado el césped, pero no nos dice qué pasa si no lo hace.

Por lo tanto, no podemos afirmar que Pablo recibió los 50 euros. De hecho, es más probable que no los haya recibido, pero con la información dada no es una certeza."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no se puede afirmar con certeza.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1.  **La declaración de María:** ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio **leerá** un libro"". Esta es una promesa o una predicción sobre el futuro.
2.  **La condición se cumple:** El contexto nos dice que ""el perro está jugando"".
3.  **La consecuencia:** Según la lógica de la declaración de María, la consecuencia es que ""Antonio leerá un libro"" (en futuro).
4.  **La diferencia clave:** La pregunta se refiere a una acción en pasado (""¿es verdad que Antonio **leyó** un libro?"").

La declaración de María nos dice lo que *sucederá*, pero no nos da información para confirmar que esa acción ya *ha sucedido*. No sabemos si Antonio ya leyó el libro, si lo está leyendo ahora mismo, o si está a punto de empezar. Por lo tanto, no podemos decir que sea verdad que ya lo leyó."
S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No.

**Explicación:**

1.  **La condición de María:** María dijo: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Esto establece una promesa o una regla condicional.
2.  **La condición se cumple:** El contexto confirma que ""El perro está jugando"".
3.  **La consecuencia según María:** Si la promesa de María se hubiera cumplido, Antonio debería haber leído un libro.
4.  **La realidad del contexto:** Sin embargo, el contexto establece como un hecho que ""Antonio no leyó ningún libro"".

Por lo tanto, aunque la condición para que Antonio leyera un libro (que el perro estuviera jugando) se cumplió, el resultado final fue el opuesto. La afirmación ""Antonio leyó un libro"" es **falsa** según los hechos presentados. Lo que dijo María no ocurrió."
S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no se puede afirmar que sea verdad.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condicional: ""Si **el perro está jugando** (condición), entonces **Antonio leerá un libro** (consecuencia)"".

El contexto nos dice que ""el perro **no** está jugando"". Esto significa que la **condición no se cumple**.

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" no se cumple, no podemos sacar ninguna conclusión sobre la consecuencia. La promesa de María no se rompe, pero tampoco nos obliga a nada.

En resumen:
*   Si el perro estuviera jugando, sabríamos que Antonio leyó un libro.
*   Como el perro no está jugando, Antonio pudo haber leído un libro por otro motivo, o pudo no haberlo leído. No tenemos información para saberlo."
S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Sí, es verdad.

Según la lógica de lo que dijo María:

1.  **La condición:** ""Si la nevera está vacía...""
2.  **El hecho:** El contexto nos dice que ""la nevera está vacía"".
3.  **La consecuencia:** ""...Ana traerá donuts.""

Como la condición se cumple, la consecuencia también debe ser cierta. Por lo tanto, según lo que decía María, Ana trajo donuts.

(El hecho de que el horno esté estropeado es información adicional que no afecta a esta conclusión)."
S9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. Ana no trajo donuts. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, no es verdad que Ana trajo donuts.

El contexto lo afirma explícitamente: **""Ana no trajo donuts""**.

Lo que dijo María (""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"") resultó ser una afirmación falsa. Aunque la condición se cumplió (la nevera está vacía), la consecuencia no (Ana no trajo donuts)."
S9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está llena. Además, el horno está encendido. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, no se puede afirmar que Ana trajo donuts.

**Explicación:**

La declaración de María es una condicional: ""Si la nevera está vacía (condición), Ana traerá donuts (consecuencia)"".

El contexto nos dice que ""la nevera está llena"", lo que significa que la **condición no se cumplió**.

Cuando la condición de un ""si... entonces..."" no se cumple, no podemos sacar ninguna conclusión sobre la consecuencia. Ana pudo traer donuts por otra razón, o no traerlos en absoluto. Lo que dijo María simplemente no nos da información sobre lo que pasó en este caso.

Por lo tanto, según la información proporcionada, **no sabemos si Ana trajo donuts o no**."
