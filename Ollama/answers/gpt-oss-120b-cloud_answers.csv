B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes. Since John is hungry and Mary’s statement is “If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven,” the condition is satisfied, so the conclusion follows: there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No.  

Mary’s conditional (“If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven”) would make the existence of pizza follow from John’s hunger **only if** the conditional were true. But we already know that there is **no** pizza in the oven. Since the antecedent (“John is hungry”) is true while the consequent (“there is pizza in the oven”) is false, Mary’s statement is false. Therefore, based on the actual facts, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No. Mary’s statement only says **if** John were hungry then pizza would be in the oven. Since we know John is *not* hungry, the antecedent of the conditional is false, so the conditional is vacuously true but it gives us no information about whether pizza is actually in the oven. In other words, we cannot infer that there is pizza in the oven."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","**Yes.**  

Mary’s statement is a conditional:

- **P:** “Nicole’s head hurts.”
- **Q:** “There is aspirin on the table.”

She says: **If P, then Q**.

The context tells us that **P is true** (“Nicole’s head hurts”).  
From a true antecedent (P) and the conditional “If P then Q,” we can apply **modus ponens** to conclude that **Q is true** – i.e., there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No.  

Mary’s sentence is the material‑implication “If Nicole’s head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.”  
Since Nicole’s head does hurt, the antecedent of the conditional is true. For the conditional to be true, the consequent – “there is aspirin on the table” – would also have to be true.  

But the given facts state explicitly that **there is no aspirin on the table**. Therefore Mary’s conditional is false, and we cannot conclude that aspirin is on the table. In fact, we know it isn’t."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No.  
Mary’s statement is a conditional:  

- **If** Nicole’s head hurts **then** there is aspirin on the table.

We know that Nicole’s head does **not** hurt, so the antecedent of the conditional is false. In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is automatically true, but it tells us nothing about the consequent. Therefore we cannot infer that aspirin is on the table; it may be there or it may not be. The truth of “there is aspirin on the table” remains undetermined."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes. Since Lucy is thirsty and Mary’s statement says that whenever Lucy is thirsty there is water in the fridge, the condition is satisfied, so we can conclude that there is water in the fridge."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No. Given that Lucy is indeed thirsty but there is **no** water in the fridge, Mary’s conditional (“If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge”) is false. So it is not true that there is water in the fridge."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No.  
Mary’s sentence is a conditional: **If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge** ( L → W ).  
We know that Lucy is *not* thirsty (L is false). In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is automatically true, but it tells us nothing about the consequent. Since the “if‑part” never occurs, we cannot infer that the “then‑part” (water in the fridge) holds.

So, based on Mary’s statement and the given facts, we have no reason to conclude that there is water in the fridge. It may be there, but it is not guaranteed."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes.  

Mary’s statement is the conditional  

\[
\text{If Peter’s phone is dead (P), then there is a charger in the drawer (C).}
\]

In the given situation we already know that Peter’s phone **is** dead (P is true).  
For a conditional “if P then C” to be true when P is true, the consequent C must also be true. Therefore, from Mary’s truthful claim and the fact that the phone is dead we can infer that there **is** a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes.  

Mary’s claim is the conditional  

\[
\text{If Peter’s phone is dead (P) then there is a charger in the drawer (C)}.
\]

We know from the context that Peter’s phone **is** dead, so the antecedent P is true.  
If a conditional “if P then C” is true and its antecedent is true, the consequent C must also be true.  

Therefore, based on Mary’s (assumed‑true) statement, there must be a charger in the drawer."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No. Mary’s statement only tells us that **if** Peter’s phone were dead, then a charger would be in the drawer. Since we know the phone is fully charged (i.e., not dead), the condition’s antecedent is false, and the statement gives us no information about whether a charger is actually in the drawer. Therefore we cannot conclude that there is a charger there."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes.  
Since the weather **is** rainy (the antecedent of Mary’s conditional statement), the condition “if the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack” requires that the consequent be true. Therefore, there is an umbrella on the coat rack."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No.  

Mary’s claim is the conditional “If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack.”  
In the actual situation the weather **is** rainy (the antecedent is true) but there is **no** umbrella on the coat rack (the consequent is false).  

A material conditional is false precisely when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. Therefore Mary’s statement is false, and we cannot conclude that an umbrella is present – in fact, we know there isn’t one."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No. Mary’s remark is only a conditional: **If** the weather were rainy, **then** there would be an umbrella on the coat rack. Since the weather is actually sunny (the antecedent is false), the conditional tells us nothing about what happens in sunny weather. Therefore, from Mary’s statement we cannot conclude that an umbrella is on the coat rack—it may be there, but we have no reason to assert that it is."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes. Since Mary says “If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage” and we know (from the context) that your tire is flat, modus ponens lets us conclude that there is indeed a pump in the garage."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No.  

Mary’s statement is the conditional  

\[
\text{If the tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage.}
\]

We know (from the given facts) that the tire **is** flat, but we also know that **there is no pump in the garage**. A conditional is true only when either its antecedent is false or its consequent is true. Here the antecedent is true and the consequent is false, so the conditional is false. Therefore, based on Mary’s claim, it is **not** true that there is a pump in the garage."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No.  
Mary’s statement is a material conditional:  

- **P** = “your tire is flat” (which we know is false)  
- **Q** = “there is a pump in the garage”

A conditional “If P, then Q” is automatically true when **P** is false, regardless of whether **Q** holds. Since we only know that the antecedent is false, Mary’s remark tells us nothing about the truth of **Q**. Therefore, from what Mary says we cannot infer that there is a pump in the garage; the existence of a pump remains undetermined."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes.  
Mary’s statement is a conditional: **If the plant is dry, then there is a water can on the shelf**.  
From the context we know the plant **is** dry. By modus ponens (the rule that from “If P then Q” and “P” we may infer “Q”), we can conclude that the consequent of the conditional – that there is a water can on the shelf – must be true.  

So, based on Mary’s claim (together with the fact that the plant is dry), it follows that there is indeed a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No. Mary’s claim is a conditional (“If the plant is dry, then there is a water‑can on the shelf”). We know the plant **is** dry, but we also know there is **no** water‑can on the shelf. Since the antecedent is true while the consequent is false, Mary’s conditional is false, and we cannot infer that a water‑can is present. In fact, there isn’t one."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No.  
Mary’s statement is a conditional: **If the plant is dry, then there is a water‑can on the shelf**.  
We know the plant is **not** dry, so the antecedent of the conditional is false. In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is automatically true, but it tells us nothing about the consequent. Since the condition “the plant is dry” never holds, we cannot infer that the water‑can is on the shelf.  

Therefore, based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is a water‑can on the shelf. It may be there, but it is not guaranteed."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes.  
Mary’s statement is the conditional “If P then Q,” where  

- P = “George’s shirt is wrinkled” (which we know is true), and  
- Q = “There is an iron in the closet.”  

From a true conditional and a true antecedent, modus ponens lets us infer the consequent. Therefore, given that the shirt is indeed wrinkled, we can conclude that there is an iron in the closet."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No.  

Mary’s claim is the conditional  

\[
\text{If (George’s shirt is wrinkled) then (there is an iron in the closet).}
\]

We know the antecedent (“George’s shirt is wrinkled”) is true, while the consequent (“there is an iron in the closet”) is false. A conditional is false precisely when its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. Therefore Mary’s statement is false, and it does **not** follow that there is an iron in the closet. In fact, there isn’t one."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No.  
Mary’s statement is a conditional:  

\[
\text{If the shirt is wrinkled (W) then there is an iron in the closet (I).}
\]

We know the shirt **is not** wrinkled (¬W). A conditional with a false antecedent is automatically true, regardless of whether the consequent (I) holds or not. Therefore the information “¬W” does not allow us to infer anything about the presence of an iron.  

So, based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is an iron in the closet; it may be there or it may not be."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No – Mary’s remark is only a conditional (“If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf”).  
From that statement alone we cannot infer that the books are actually on the shelf; the antecedent (Susy wants to read) might be false, in which case the conditional would be true even if there were no books. So, based solely on what Mary says, we cannot say for certain that there are books on the shelf."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes – if we take Mary’s conditional (“If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf”) as true and we know that Susy does want to read, then the consequent must be true. In other words, according to Mary’s statement there are books on the shelf."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No.  
Mary’s statement is a conditional:  

\[
\text{If Susy wants to read (W), then there are books on the shelf (B).}
\]

We know from the context that **Susy does not want to read** (¬W). In classical logic a conditional with a false antecedent is automatically true, but it tells us nothing about the truth of the consequent. From ¬W we cannot infer B nor ¬B.

Therefore, based solely on Mary’s statement we cannot conclude that there are books on the shelf; the shelf may or may not contain books."
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?",Yes. Pizza is more popular than pasta.
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?",No. Pizza is actually more popular than pasta.
F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","**Yes.**  
Even though black coffee costs less, the statement that “most people prefer green tea” indicates that, in practice, green tea is consumed more often than black coffee. Preference among the majority typically translates into higher usage."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","No. Even though black coffee is cheaper and there’s some in the pot, most people prefer green tea, so green tea is used more often than black coffee."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Based on the given context, soda appears to be in higher demand than water—people are choosing soda more often despite water being the healthier option."
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","Overall, **water is in higher demand than soda**—it’s a basic necessity that everyone needs to drink every day, whereas soda is a discretionary, optional beverage.  

That said, the context notes that “many choose soda” despite water being healthier, which reflects a **higher per‑person preference for soda in certain situations** (e.g., taste, marketing, habit). So:

- **Total market demand** (volume sold/consumed) → water > soda.  
- **Consumer preference in specific moments** (e.g., when a choice is presented) → soda can out‑compete water.

In short, water’s overall demand outstrips soda’s, even though soda may win the “choice” battle in many individual instances."
F4T,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context, is broccoli more popular than gnocchi?",Yes—broccoli is more popular than gnocchi.

F5T,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, are burgers more popular than sushi?","Yes. People tend to eat burgers more often than sushi, so burgers are more popular."

F7F,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are cats more popular than dogs?","No. In the given context, people prefer dogs over cats, so cats are not more popular than dogs."
F8T,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people watching TV than reading books?","Yes. Most people watch TV, so more people are watching TV than reading books."
F8F,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people reading books than watching TV?","No. According to the context, most people watch TV, so fewer people are reading books than watching TV."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Yes.  
- We know the parrot **is** in the cage (the premise P is true).  
- Mary’s statement gives the conditional “If the parrot is in the cage, then Thomas will bring pizza” ( P → Q).  

From a true conditional and a true antecedent, modus ponens lets us infer the consequent. Therefore, based on what Mary says, Thomas did bring pizza."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No – Thomas did **not** bring pizza.

**Why?**  
We are told explicitly that “Thomas did not bring pizza.” Mary’s remark (“If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza”) is a conditional statement. Its antecedent – “the parrot is in the cage” – is indeed true, so for Mary’s conditional to be true the consequent would have to be true (i.e., Thomas would have to bring pizza).

S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes. Since Mary said “If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy,” and you did finish your broccoli, the condition of her statement is met.

Mary’s statement is a conditional:  

- **If** you finish your broccoli **then** Mark will give you a candy.  

You did finish your broccoli, so the antecedent of the conditional is true.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: **If you finish your broccoli, then Mark will give you a candy.**  
Since you *didn’t* finish your broccoli, the antecedent of the conditional is false. From that we cannot infer anything about the consequent; the statement does not guarantee a candy when the condition isn’t met. Therefore, based solely on what Mary said, we have no reason to conclude that Mark gave you a candy."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes.  
Since Mary said “If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera” and we know the foxes **are** dancing, the condition of her statement is met. Assuming Mary’s statement is true, the conclusion follows: Susan will (and therefore did) get a camera."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"".

S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No. Mary’s statement only tells us what would happen **if** the TV were on. Since the TV is actually off, the condition isn’t met, and the statement gives us no information about whether Matthew baked cookies or not. Therefore we cannot say that Matthew baked cookies; the truth of that claim is undetermined."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"".

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No. Mary’s remark only says **if** the weather were sunny then Emma would wear purple. Since the weather is actually rainy (and windy), the antecedent of the conditional is false, so the statement gives us no information about what Emma actually wore. In other words, we cannot conclude that Emma wore purple."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Yes. Since the playground is indeed empty, Mary’s conditional statement (“If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie”) triggers, so we can conclude that Angela took (or will take) a selfie."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No.  

Mary’s conditional says:  

*If the playground is empty, then Angela will take a selfie.*

The antecedent (“the playground is empty”) is indeed true, so for Mary’s statement to be true the consequent (“Angela will take a selfie”) would also have to be true.  

But we are told explicitly that **Angela did not take a selfie**. Hence the consequent is false, making Mary’s conditional false.  

Therefore, based on the information (including Mary’s claim), it is **not true** that Angela took a selfie."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No. Mary’s statement only says that **if** the playground were empty, then Angela would take a selfie. Since the playground is *crowded* (i.e., not empty), the condition’s antecedent is false, and the statement gives us no information about what Angela does in that case. Therefore we cannot infer that Angela took a selfie; it may or may not have happened."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No – we can’t conclude that Paul received the €50.

Mary’s statement is only a **conditional**:  

- **If** Paul mows the lawn → **then** he will get €50.  

It does **not** say that Paul actually mowed the lawn, nor that the payment was made.  

All we know from the context is that *the lawn has been mowed* (by someone) and that Mary made the conditional promise. Since we have no information about who did the mowing, we cannot infer that Paul got the money. The statement “Paul got €50” may be true, but it is not guaranteed by the given information."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No.  

Even though Mary said “If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros,” and we know the lawn **has** been mowed, we are also told explicitly that **Paul did not get 50 euros**. That factual statement overrides the implication of Mary’s conditional—either Mary’s promise was not fulfilled or her conditional was false. Therefore, based on the information given, Paul did **not** receive 50 euros."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No. Mary’s statement is a conditional: *If* Paul mows the lawn, *then* he will get 50 €, but the lawn **has not** been mowed. Since the antecedent of the condition is false, we have no reason to infer that Paul received the money. In other words, from the information given we cannot say that Paul got 50 € (and it is most likely false)."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Yes. Since the dog is indeed playing and Mary’s conditional statement (“If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book”) is taken as true, we can infer by modus ponens that Anthony reads a book."
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","**Answer:** According to Mary’s conditional, **yes** – the fact that the dog is playing forces the conclusion that “Anthony will read a book.”  

**Why this creates a contradiction:**  
- We are also told explicitly that “Anthony did **not** read a book.”  
- Mary’s statement (“If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book”) together with the true premise “the dog is playing” entails that Anthony **did** read a book.  

Thus, if we accept Mary’s claim as true, we must conclude that Anthony read a book; but this directly conflicts with the given fact that he did not. The premises are therefore inconsistent. In a logically consistent world you would have to reject either Mary’s statement or the claim that Anthony didn’t read the book."
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No. Mary’s statement is only a conditional: “If the dog is playing, then Anthony will read a book.” Since we know the dog **is not** playing, the antecedent of the conditional is false, so the statement tells us nothing about what Anthony actually does. Therefore, based on Mary’s remark we cannot conclude that Anthony read a book."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"".

The fridge **is** empty, so Mary’s conditional “If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts” would require Amy to bring donuts. But we are told explicitly that **Amy did not bring donuts**. Since the antecedent (the fridge being empty) is true while the consequent (Amy bringing donuts) is false, Mary’s statement is false, and the fact remains that Amy did **not** bring donuts."

B1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i hi ha pizza al forn. També hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Sí, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn.

**Raonament**

1. **Premissa de la Maria**: «Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn».  
   Aquesta és una proposició condicional de la forma *Si P, aleshores Q*.

2. **Sabem que**: *P* (en Joan té gana) és cert (es dóna al context).

3. En una condició *Si P → Q*, quan *P* és cert, la veritat de la proposició depèn de que *Q* també sigui cert.  

4. Com que la premissa de la Maria afirma que, en el cas que *P* sigui cert, *Q* (hi ha pizza al forn) ha de ser cert, i a més el context ens diu explícitament que **hi ha pizza al forn**, la conclusió és que la proposició de la Maria és certa.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria (i confirmat pel context), **hi ha pizza al forn**."
B1F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i no hi ha pizza al forn. Tampoc no hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No.  

Segons el que diu la Maria, la frase és una condició:

\[
\text{“Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn”}\;\; \Longleftrightarrow\;\; J \rightarrow P
\]

On  
- \(J\) = “En Joan té gana” (cert),  
- \(P\) = “Hi ha pizza al forn”.

Una condició \(J \rightarrow P\) només és falsa quan el primer terme és cert i el segon és fals.  
En el context sabem que:

- \(J\) és cert (en Joan té gana).  
- \(P\) és fals (no hi ha pizza al forn).

Així, la condició de la Maria és **falsa**. Per tant, segons el que ella afirma, la única manera perquè la seva frase fos certa seria que hi hagués pizza, però com que no n’hi ha, la conclusió és que **no hi ha pizza al forn**."
B1C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan no té gana. Hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Segons la frase de la Maria:

\[
\text{Si (En Joan té gana) → (hi ha pizza al forn)}
\]

el **antecedent** (“En Joan té gana”) és **fals**, ja que el context ens diu que *En Joan no té gana*.  

En lògica clàssica una condicional amb antecedent fals és **sempre veritable**, independentment del valor del consequent. Això vol dir que la frase de la Maria és **veritable**, però **no ens dóna cap informació sobre el consequent** (“hi ha pizza al forn”).

Per tant, a partir del que diu la Maria i del fet que en Joan no té gana, **no podem concloure que hi hagi pizza al forn**; podria haver‑hi o no haver‑hi.

**Resposta:** No, no es pot afirmar que hi hagi pizza al forn; la frase de la Maria no la garanteix."
B2T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","Sí.  

La Maria afirma: «Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula».  
Aquesta és una proposició condicional del tipus **P → Q**, on  

* **P** = “la Núria té mal de cap”  
* **Q** = “hi ha aspirines sobre la taula”.

En el context se sap que **P** és cert (la Núria realment té mal de cap).  
Si acceptem que la frase de la Maria és veritable, una condició **P → Q** només pot ser certa quan, sempre que **P** sigui certa, **Q** també ho és. Per tant, amb **P** verificat, la veritat de la condicional implica que **Q** ha de ser certa.

Així, segons el que diu la Maria, **hi ha aspirines sobre la taula**."
B2F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. Tampoc no hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","Sí.  

La Maria afirma la condició  

\[
\text{Si (Núria té mal de cap) aleshores (hi ha aspirines sobre la taula)}.

Del context sabem que **Núria té mal de cap** (premissa \(P\) és certa).  
Aplicat el modus ponens a la frase de la Maria:

\[
P \;\Rightarrow\; Q,\qquad P\;\text{(cert)}\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; Q

on \(Q\) és “hi ha aspirines sobre la taula”. Per tant, **segons el que diu la Maria**, la conclusió és que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula.

La frase de la Maria és una condició lògica:  

**«Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula».**  

En l’enunciat sabem que **la Núria no té mal de cap**. En lògica clàssica una condició «Si P, llavors Q» és veritable quan **P** és fals, independentment del valor de **Q**. Per tant, el que diu la Maria és una proposició **veritable**, però només perquè l’antècedent (que la Núria tingui mal de cap) és fals.

Això no ens dóna cap informació sobre la veritat del consequent «hi ha aspirines sobre la taula». Podria ser cert o fals; la frase de la Maria no el determina.

**Conclusió:** segons el que diu la Maria, no podem afirmar que hi hagi aspirines sobre la taula; la resposta és **no, no és veritat que hi hagi aspirines (no es pot deduir).**"
B3T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia té set i hi ha aigua a la nevera. També hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No.  
La frase de la Maria només diu **«Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua a la nevera»** (L → A). Un enunciat condicional no afirma que hi hagi aigua; només estableix que, en el cas que la Llúcia tingui set, aleshores hi ha aigua. Per tant, a partir del que diu la Maria no podem concloure que hi hagi aigua a la nevera. (Caldria conèixer que la Llúcia realment té set per poder deduir‑ho.)"
B3F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia té set i no hi ha aigua a la nevera. Tampoc no hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No.  

Segons la Maria, la frase que afirma és la condicional

En el context sabem que:

* **L** (la Llúcia té set) és **cert**.  
* **¬A** (no hi ha aigua a la nevera) és **cert**.

Una condicional només és falsa quan el seu antecedent és cert i el seu consequent és fals. Aquí l’antecedent **L** és cert i el consequent **A** és fals, de manera que la condicional **L → A** és **falsa**.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, la proposició «hi ha aigua a la nevera» **no és veritable** (de fet, la seva afirmació és contradicció amb la realitat).  

**Resposta:** No, no hi ha aigua a la nevera."
B3C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia no té set. Hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No.  

La frase de la Maria és una condicional:  

**Si la Llúcia té set, llavors hi ha aigua a la nevera**  
\(S \rightarrow A\).

Sabem, per la informació del context, que **la Llúcia no té set** (\(\neg S\)).  

En lògica, una condicional amb antecedent fals (\(\neg S\)) és sempre veritable, independentment del valor del consequent (\(A\)). Per tant, la frase de la Maria és veritable, però no ens dóna cap informació sobre si realment hi ha aigua o no.

Com que l’antencedent és fals, no podem inferir el consequent; així que **no podem afirmar que hi hagi aigua a la nevera**. Pot haver‑hi o no, però la informació donada no ho determina."

La Maria afirma una proposició condicional:  

**Si** el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, **aleshores** hi ha un carregador al calaix.  

En el context se sap que el mòbil **realment** no té bateria. Per tant, l’antècedent de la condició és cert.  

Si acceptem que la frase de la Maria és veritable, el consequent ha de ser cert també; d’altra manera la proposició condicional seria falsa.  

Així, segons el que diu la Maria, hi ha un carregador al calaix."
B4F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria i no hi ha cap carregador al calaix. Tampoc no hi ha cap ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","Sí.  

Segons la Maria, la frase que ha dit és una condició del tipus

\]

és a dir, \(P \rightarrow Q\) on  

* \(P\): “el mòbil del Pere no té bateria” (aquest fet és cert),  
* \(Q\): “hi ha un carregador al calaix”.

En lògica clàssica, una condició \(P \rightarrow Q\) només pot ser veritable quan \(P\) és cert **i** \(Q\) també és cert. Com que \(P\) és cert (el mòbil no té bateria), per a que la frase de la Maria sigui veritable ha de ser cert que \(Q\) ho és, és a dir, que hi hagi un carregador al calaix.

Així, **segons el que diu la Maria**, sí que hi ha un carregador al calaix.

El que diu la Maria és només una condició:

> **Si** el mòbil del Pere **no** té bateria, **aleshores** hi ha un carregador al calaix.

En la realitat sabem que **el mòbil del Pere està carregat** (té bateria). Per tant l’antècedent de la condició (“el mòbil no té bateria”) és fals. Quan l’antècedent d’un “si… aleshores…” és fals, la frase completa és considerada veritable, però no ens dóna cap informació sobre el consequent (“hi ha un carregador al calaix”).

Així doncs, a partir del que diu la Maria no podem concloure que hi hagi (o no hi hagi) un carregador al calaix; simplement no tenim prou informació. Per tant, **no és cert que, segons la Maria, hi hagi un carregador al calaix**. (Pot haver‑hi o no, però no es pot afirmar)."

Així, **segons el que diu la Maria, la resposta és “sí”.**  

No obstant això, la informació del context indica que **no hi ha cap paraigüell al paraigüer**, de manera que la proposició de la Maria és falsa en la realitat. Per tant, la veritat de la frase depèn de si ens basem exclusivament en el que ella afirma (en aquest cas, sí) o en les dades objectives del context (en aquest cas, no)."

Això només ens assegura que, en cas que **el temps fos plujós**, hi hauria un paraigüell.  

Com que al context s’indica que **el temps és serè** (per tant, l’antècedent “el temps és plujós” és fals), la condició no ens dóna cap informació sobre el consequent. No podem deduir que hi hagi o no un paraigüell al paraigüer; simplement no sabem.  

Així, segons el que diu la Maria, **no és veritat que puguem afirmar que hi ha un paraigüell al paraigüer**. (Només podem dir que la seva frase és veritable com a implicació lògica, però no que el consequent sigui real.)"

* \(P\): «la roda del cotxe està punxada» (premissa)  
* \(Q\): «hi ha un inflador al garatge» (conseqüència).

Una implicació només és **vertadera** quan, sempre que la premissa \(P\) sigui certa, la conclusió \(Q\) també ho sigui. Com que aquí \(P\) és certa i \(Q\) és falsa, l’implicació **\(P \rightarrow Q\) és falsa**.

Així, **segons el que diu la Maria**, la seva afirmació implicaria que hi hauria un inflador al garatge; però com que la realitat demostra que no n’hi ha, la frase de la Maria és falsa. Per tant, **no és veritat que hi hagi un inflador al garatge**."
B6C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La roda del cotxe està inflada. Hi ha una bicicleta a la porta d'entrada. La Maria diu: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","No.

### Raonament lògic

1. **Premisses del context**  
   - \(P\): “La planta està seca”. → **cert**.

3. **Aplicació del modus ponens** (si acceptem la premissa de la Maria com a veritable)  
   - Com que \(P\) és cert, el condicional \(P \rightarrow Q\) ens obliga a concloure \(Q\) (hi ha una regadora).

4. **Contradicció amb la informació del context**  
   - Però el context diu \(\neg Q\). Això vol dir que la premissa de la Maria (\(P \rightarrow Q\)) **no pot ser certa**; en realitat és falsa, ja que un condicional amb antecedent cert i consequent fals és fals.

### Conclusió

- **Segons la lògica de la frase de la Maria** (ignorant la informació real), la resposta seria **sí**: hi hauria una regadora a la prestatgeria.
- **En la realitat del context**, la frase de la Maria és falsa, i per tant **no** hi ha cap regadora a la prestatgeria.

Així, la resposta depèn de si ens basem exclusivament en el que diu la Maria (sí) o en la situació real descrita (no). En un examen de lògica, la resposta esperada sol ser: *Segons el que diu la Maria, sí, hi ha una regadora; però això contradiu el fet que realment no n’hi ha, de manera que la seva afirmació és falsa.*"
B7C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La planta no està seca. Hi ha una mànega al jardí. La Maria diu: ""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria?","No.  

La frase de la Maria és una condició lògica:

- **P**: «La planta està seca».  
- **Q**: «Hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria».  

Maria diu: **Si P, llavors Q** ( \(P \rightarrow Q\) ).

Sabem que **P és fals** (la planta **no** està seca). En lògica, una implicació amb antecedent fals és **sempre vertadera**, independentment del valor de **Q**. Per tant, el que podem afirmar amb seguretat és que la frase de la Maria és vertadera, però **no podem deduir cap informació sobre Q**.

Així, no podem dir que hi hagi (ni que no hi hagi) una regadora a la prestatgeria només a partir del que diu la Maria. La resposta és, doncs, **no, no és cert que hi hagi una regadora a la prestatgeria segons la informació proporcionada**."
B8T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La camisa del Jordi està arrugada i hi ha una planxa a l'armari. També hi ha una taula de planxar al balcó. La Maria diu: ""Si la camisa del jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?","No.  

El que diu la Maria és només una **condicional**:

> **Si** la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, **aleshores** hi ha una planxa a l'armari.

Una frase del tipus “si A, llavors B” no afirma cap de les dues proposicions per separat; només estableix una relació d’implicació entre elles. Per tant, sense saber si la camisa del Jordi realment està arrugada, no podem concloure que la planxa estigui a l’armari.

En resum, segons la Maria **no es pot afirmar** que hi hagi una planxa a l’armari; només sap que, en cas que la camisa estigui arrugada, la planxa hi seria."

Segons la Maria, la frase «Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l’armari» és una condició del tipus **P → Q** (on *P* = “la camisa està arrugada” i *Q* = “hi ha una planxa a l’armari”).  

En el context sabem que:

* *P* és certa (la camisa està arrugada).  
* Però també sabem que *Q* és falsa (no hi ha cap planxa a l’armari).

Una implicació **P → Q** només pot ser certa quan, si *P* és certa, *Q* també ho és. Com que *P* és certa i *Q* és falsa, la implicació que afirma la Maria és **falsa**. Per tant, la conclusió que hi hauria una planxa a l’armari, que la Maria intenta inferir, no és certa.

Ella afirma: **Si P, llavors Q** ( P → Q ).

Sabem, per la informació del context, que **P és falsa** (la camisa del Jordi **no** té arrugues). En lògica, una implicació amb antecedent fals és sempre veritable, independentment del valor de Q. Per tant, el fet que la condició sigui veritable no ens dóna cap informació sobre si Q és certa o falsa.

Així, segons el que diu la Maria, **no podem concloure que hi hagi una planxa a l'armari**; pot haver‑ne o no. La resposta és: **no, no és veritat que hi hagi una planxa a l'armari (no es pot afirmar).**"

Segons la Maria, **si** la Susanna vol llegir **aleshores** hi ha llibres a l’estanteria. Com que al context es dóna que la Susanna **vol llegir**, l’antècedent de la condició és cert; per tant, per la regla del modus ponens, el consequent també ha de ser cert.

Sabem, per la informació del context, que **S** és cert (la Susanna vol llegir).  

En una implicació, si el primer terme (**S**) és cert, l’únic que garanteix que la implicació sigui certa és que també **B** sigui cert. Per tant, **segons el que diu la Maria**, ha de ser cert que hi ha llibres a l’estanteria.

Així, la resposta a la pregunta «És veritat que hi ha llibres a l’estanteria?» **segons la Maria** és:

**Sí, segons la Maria hi ha llibres a l’estanteria.**

El que diu la Maria és només la condició «Si la Susanna vol llegir, llavors hi ha llibres a l’estanteria» (V → B).

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza?","**Resposta:** Sí, **segons el que diu la Maria** és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza.

**Raonament**

1. **Premissa de la Maria:**  
   > «Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza.»

2. **Situació real:**  
   - El lloro **és** a la gàbia (premissa veritable).  
   - Per tant, l’antècedent de la condició de la Maria és **cert**.

3. **Interpretació de la condició:**  
   En una frase del tipus «Si *P*, llavors *Q*», quan *P* és cert, la frase afirma que *Q* també ha de ser cert. Així, la Maria està afirmant que **el Tomàs portarà pizza**.

4. **Conclusió segons la Maria:**  
   Com que l’antècedent (*el lloro és a la gàbia*) és cert, la Maria sosté que el consequent (*el Tomàs portarà pizza*) és cert. Per tant, **segons la Maria**, el Tomàs ha portat pizza.

> **Nota aclaridora:** En el context també es diu que «el Tomàs no ha portat pizza», la qual cosa contradiu la afirmació de la Maria. Però la pregunta demana exactament *segons el que diu la Maria*, i en aquest marc la resposta és afirmativa."
S1C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El lloro no és a la gàbia. El gos tampoc no és a la gossera. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza?","No.  

La frase de la Maria és una condició lògica del tipus  

\[
\text{«Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza»}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad P \rightarrow T,
\]

on \(P\) = «el lloro és a la gàbia» i \(T\) = «el Tomàs porta pizza».  

Sabem, per la informació del context, que **el lloro no és a la gàbia** (\(\neg P\)). En lògica clàssica una implicació amb antecedent fals (\(\neg P\)) és sempre veritable (és a dir, la frase de la Maria és veritat‑vacuosa). Però aquest fet no dóna cap informació sobre el consequent \(T\); el fet que l’implicació sigui certa no implica que \(T\) sigui cert.

Per tant, a partir del que diu la Maria no podem concloure que el Tomàs hagi portat pizza. La resposta és **no, no és cert (i no es pot determinar) que el Tomàs hagi portat pizza**."

   - Formalment: **B → C**, on **C** = “la Júlia rebrà una càmera fotogràfica”.

3. **Avaluació del condicional**  
   - En lògica clàssica, un condicional **B → C** és **vertader** quan l’antècedent **B** és fals, independentment del valor de **C**.  
   - Com que sabem que ¬B (les guineus **no** ballen), el condicional **B → C** és cert, però això **no** ens dóna cap informació sobre **C**.

4. **Conclusió sobre **C****  
   - No tenim cap premissa que indiqui que **C** (la Júlia ha rebut la càmera) sigui certa o falsa.  
   - Per tant, no podem deduir que la Júlia hagi rebut la càmera; la frase de la Maria només estableix una relació condicional que, en aquest cas, és trivialment certa perquè l’antècedent no es compleix.

Així, **segons el que diu la Maria, sí que és veritat que l’Alba s’ha fet una selfie** (perquè el precedent de la condició es compleix).  

Cal notar, però, que la informació addicional del context afirma que *l’Alba no s’ha fet cap selfie*, de manera que la realitat contradiu la predicció de la Maria. Però la pregunta demana exactament “segons el que diu la Maria”, i en aquest marc la resposta és afirmativa."

S7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","No.  

El que ha dit la Maria és una condició: **«Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros»**.  
El fet que la gespa ja estigui tallada només ens indica que algú l’ha tallat, però no ens dóna cap informació sobre qui ha estat. Per tant, no podem afirmar que el Pau hagi tallat la gespa ni que, en conseqüència, hagi rebut els 50 euros.

Segons la frase de la Maria:

- **Dada**: «El Pau no ha rebut 50 €».

En una implicació lògica (*si A, llavors B*), si el consequent **B** és fals, l’antecedent **A** ha de ser fals (perquè una implicació només és falsa quan A és vertader i B és fals).  

Com que sabem que **B** (que el Pau rebi 50 €) és fals, deduïm que **A** (que el Pau talli la gespa) també ha de ser fals. Per tant, el Pau **no** ha tallat la gespa i, en conseqüència, **no** ha rebut els 50 €.

S8T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El gos està jugant. A més, el gat està pujant a l'arbre. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre?","Segons la frase de la Maria:

- **Premissa**: *El gos està jugant* (això és cert segons el context).  
- **Condicional**: *Si el gos està jugant, l’Antoni llegirà un llibre*.

Com que la premissa és certa, el condicional ens obliga a acceptar que **l’Antoni llegirà** un llibre (és a dir, que ho farà en algun moment del futur).  

No obstant això, la pregunta demana si **“l’Antoni ha llegit”** un llibre, és a dir, si ja l’ha fet. El verb que utilitza la Maria és *llegirà* (futur), no *ha llegit* (passat). Per tant, a partir de la informació donada només podem concloure que Antoni **llegirà** un llibre, però no podem afirmar que ja l’ha llegit.

**Resposta:** No es pot dir que l’Antoni ja ha llegit un llibre; només sabem que, segons la Maria, ho farà."

Cal notar, però, que una altra premissa del context afirma que *l’Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre*. Això crea una contradicció entre la informació factual i la predicció de la Maria. Però la pregunta demana **segons el que diu la Maria**, i en aquest marc la resposta és:

Això és una condició del tipus *P → Q* (P = “la nevera està buida”, Q = “l’Anna porta donuts”).  

Com que al context sabem que **la nevera està plena** (per tant P és fals), la condició és veritable independentment de si Q es compleix o no.

Maria afferma: «Se Gianni ha fame, c’è della pizza in forno» ( \(G \rightarrow P\) ).  
Nel contesto sappiamo che Gianni ha fame (\(G\) è vero).  
In una proposizione condizionale, quando l’antecedente è vero, l’intera frase è vera solo se anche il conseguente lo è; quindi da \(G\) e da \(G \rightarrow P\) deduciamo logicamente \(P\) (c’è della pizza in forno).  

Quindi, **in base a quello che dice Maria**, la conclusione è che la pizza è in forno. (Ovviamente, nella realtà il fatto è contraddetto dalle altre informazioni, ma la deduzione logica dalla sua frase porta a questa conclusione.)"

Il ragionamento di Maria è un “se… allora…”:  

- **Premessa di Maria**: “Se Gianni ha fame, allora c’è della pizza in forno”.  
- **Fatto noto**: Gianni **non** ha fame.

Poiché l’antecedente (“Gianni ha fame”) è falso, la condizione non è soddisfatta; il fatto che la frase sia logicamente vera (un “se” con antecedente falso è vero per definizione) non implica che il conseguente (“c’è della pizza in forno”) sia vero.  

Quindi, in base a quanto dice Maria, non possiamo affermare che la pizza sia nel forno."

Maria afferma: «Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo».  
Poiché dal contesto sappiamo che Nicoletta ha effettivamente mal di testa, l’antecedente della sua proposizione è vero. Perché la frase condizionale di Maria sia vera, il conseguente deve anch’esso essere vero. Dunque, in base a quanto dice Maria, è vero che sul tavolo ci sono delle aspirine."

Maria afferma: «Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo».  
Poiché sappiamo che **Nicoletta ha davvero mal di testa**, il suo enunciato implica (per modus ponens) che **ci dovrebbero essere delle aspirine sul tavolo**.  

Tuttavia il contesto dichiara esplicitamente che **non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo**. Quindi la conclusione a cui Maria arriva è falsa: la sua frase è contraddittoria rispetto ai fatti noti.

Maria ha affermato solo una **implicazione**:  

- *Se* Nicoletta ha mal di testa → *allora* ci sono aspirine sul tavolo.

Poiché sappiamo che **Nicoletta non ha mal di testa** (l’antecedente è falso), l’implicazione è considerata vera in logica classica, ma non ci dà alcuna informazione sul conseguente.

Maria afferma: «Se Lucia ha sete, allora c’è dell’acqua in frigo».

Maria ha affermato solo il condizionale «Se Lucia ha sete, allora c’è dell’acqua in frigo» ( L → A ).  
Dal contesto sappiamo che **Lucia non ha sete** (¬L). Quando l’antecedente di un condizionale è falso, il condizionale è vero a prescindere dal valore dell’anticedente (qui, dell’acqua).  

Quindi il fatto che Lucia non abbia sete non ci permette di dedurre né che l’acqua sia presente né che non lo sia. Dalla sola affermazione di Maria non possiamo affermare che “c’è dell’acqua in frigo” sia vero.

Il ragionamento è il seguente:

1. Maria afferma la proposizione condizionale

2. Dal contesto sappiamo che il telefono di Pietro è effettivamente scarico.  

3. Quando l’antecedente di una condizionale è vero, la verità della condizionale dipende dalla verità del conseguente.

dove

**Ragionamento**

1. **Premessa del contesto**: “Il tempo è piovoso”.  
2. **Affermazione di Maria**: “Se il tempo è piovoso, c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli” (una proposizione condizionale del tipo *Se P, allora Q*).  
3. **Applicazione del modus ponens**: poiché la condizione *P* (“il tempo è piovoso”) è verificata, ne consegue logicamente la conclusione *Q* (“c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli”).

Quindi, in base a quanto dice Maria e al fatto che la premessa è soddisfatta, possiamo affermare con certezza che **c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli**."
B5F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. Non c'è nemmeno un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No.

Questa è una proposizione condizionale del tipo **P → Q** (dove *P* = “il tempo è piovoso”, *Q* = “c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli”).  

Perché la condizionale sia vera, è necessario che **non si verifichi il caso in cui P è vero e Q è falso**.  
Nel contesto sappiamo che:

* il tempo è effettivamente piovoso (*P* è vero);
* **non** c’è alcun ombrello nel portaombrelli (*Q* è falso).

Quindi si verifica la combinazione P ∧ ¬Q, che rende falsa la proposizione di Maria. Di conseguenza, la conclusione “c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli” non è vera.

Maria ha affermato solo una **implicazione**:  

- *Se* il tempo è piovoso → c’è un ombrello nel portaombrelli.  

Il tempo, però, è **sereno** (l’antecedente è falso). In logica una proposizione del tipo “se P allora Q” è considerata vera quando P è falso, ma ciò non fornisce alcuna informazione su Q.  

Quindi, dal solo enunciato di Maria non possiamo dedurre che nel portaombrelli ci sia effettivamente un ombrello; la sua affermazione non garantisce nulla quando il tempo non è piovoso.

**Ragionamento**

1. **Premessa di fatto** (fornita dal contesto):

   Quindi l’antecedente della frase di Maria è vero.

2. **Affermato da Maria**:  
   *“Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c’è una pompa in garage.”*  
   Questa è una proposizione condizionale del tipo **Se P allora Q**.

3. **Regola logica**: dal modus ponens, se sappiamo che **P** è vero e che la proposizione **Se P allora Q** è vera, allora possiamo dedurre che **Q** è vero.

4. Applicando la regola:  
   - **P** = “la gomma della macchina è a terra” (vero).  
   - **Se P allora Q** = “se la gomma è a terra, c’è una pompa in garage” (ciò che Maria afferma).  

   Da queste due premesse segue che **Q** = “c’è una pompa in garage” è vero.

Poiché, nel contesto, la premessa «la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata» è vera, la condizionale impone che anche la conclusione «c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio» sia vera. Quindi, in base a quanto dice Maria, è vero che c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio."
B8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non c'è nemmeno un'asse da stiro in balcone.

Nel contesto sappiamo che:

- la camicia di Giorgio è **stropicciata** (S);
- **non** c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio (¬F).

Maria afferma: «Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio», cioè la proposizione logica **S → F**.

Una implicazione è falsa solo quando l’antecedente è vero e il conseguente è falso.  
Qui l’antecedente (S) è vero e il conseguente (F) è falso (¬F). Quindi l’affermazione di Maria è falsa, e di conseguenza **non c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio**."

La frase di Maria è un “se… allora…”:  

- **P** = «la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata»  
- **Q** = «c’è un ferro da stiro nell’armadio»

Sappiamo che la camicia è **stirata**, quindi **P** è falsa. In logica un condizionale è vero quando l’antecedente è falso, indipendentemente dal valore del conseguente. Perciò la frase di Maria è vera, ma non ci dà alcuna informazione su **Q**.  

Quindi non possiamo affermare che **c’è** un ferro da stiro nell’armadio; la sua presenza non è deducibile dal detto di Maria."
B9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. C'è anche un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","Sì.  
Maria afferma: «Se Susanna vuole leggere, allora ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale».

Secondo la frase di Maria «Se Susanna vuole leggere, allora ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale», il ragionamento corretto sarebbe:

1. **Premessa**: Susanna vuole leggere.  
2. **Condizionale**: Se Susanna vuole leggere → ci sono libri.  
3. **Conclusione (modus ponens)**: ci sono libri.

Tuttavia, nel contesto ci è stato detto esplicitamente che **non ci sono libri sullo scaffale**. Quindi la premessa del condizionale è vera (Susanna vuole leggere) ma la conclusione è falsa. Questo significa che il condizionale enunciato da Maria è **falso** (un “se… allora…” è vero solo quando, ogni volta che la premessa è vera, anche la conclusione lo è).  

Pertanto, basandoci sui fatti reali del contesto, **non è vero che ci siano dei libri sullo scaffale**; la frase di Maria è semplicemente errata."

Maria ha detto solo «Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale» ( W → B ).  
Sappiamo che Susanna **non** vuole leggere (¬W). Da una implicazione con antecedente falso non possiamo dedurre nulla sul conseguente: la frase è vera sia che ci siano libri sia che non ci siano.

F9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante correre sia meglio per la forma fisica rispetto a camminare, la maggior parte delle persone preferisce camminare. C'è un corridore in pista. In questo contesto, correre è meglio per la forma fisica di camminare?","**Sì, in generale correre è più efficace di camminare per migliorare la forma fisica**, ma la risposta dipende da quali obiettivi si vogliono raggiungere, dal livello di partenza e dalle condizioni di salute di ciascuno.

| Aspetto | Corsa | Camminata |
|---|---|---|
| **Consumo energetico** | Brucia circa 2‑3 volte più calorie per minuto (≈ 10‑15 kcal/min a ritmo moderato). | Brucia meno calorie (≈ 4‑6 kcal/min a passo sostenuto). |
| **Capacità aerobica (VO₂ max)** | Stimola un aumento più rapido del VO₂ max, migliorando la resistenza cardiovascolare. | Incrementa il VO₂ max, ma a un ritmo più lento. |
| **Forza muscolare** | Coinvolge maggiormente i muscoli delle gambe (quadricipiti, glutei, polpacci) e il core per stabilizzazione. | Attiva i muscoli in modo più delicato, ottimo per tonificazione leggera. |
| **Densità ossea** | L’impatto più elevato favorisce la mineralizzazione ossea, utile per prevenire l’osteoporosi. | Ha un impatto ridotto, quindi meno beneficio per la densità ossea. |
| **Rischio infortuni** | Maggiore rischio di sovraccarico (tendiniti, stress alle articolazioni). | Rischio più basso; adatto a persone con problemi articolari o in fase di riabilitazione. |
| **Accessibilità** | Richiede una buona base di fitness e, talvolta, attrezzature (scarpe specifiche). | Può essere praticata da quasi tutti, a qualsiasi età, senza attrezzature particolari. |
| **Benefici psicologici** | Rilascia più endorfine in tempi brevi, favorendo l’effetto “runner’s high”. | Riduce lo stress e migliora l’umore, ma con un picco di endorfine più moderato. |

### Quando la corsa è la scelta migliore
- **Obiettivo di perdita di peso**: brucia più calorie in meno tempo.  
- **Miglioramento della capacità aerobica**: per sport di resistenza o per aumentare il VO₂ max.  
- **Rinforzo osseo e muscolare**: se non ci sono limitazioni articolari.  

### Quando la camminata può essere più adatta
- **Principianti o persone con problemi articolari/lesioni**.  
- **Allenamento di recupero attivo** o giorni a bassa intensità.  
- **Mantenimento della salute generale** quando il tempo o la motivazione sono limitati.  

### Conclusione
Correre è **più efficace** per migliorare rapidamente la forma fisica in termini di capacità cardiovascolare, consumo calorico e rinforzo muscolo‑scheletrico. Tuttavia, la camminata resta un’attività **altamente benefica**, a basso impatto e più sostenibile per molte persone. La scelta ideale spesso consiste in una combinazione di entrambe le attività, adattata al proprio livello di fitness, ai propri obiettivi e alle proprie condizioni di salute."

Tuttavia camminare ha comunque dei benefici (meno impatto sulle articolazioni, è più sostenibile per chi è alle prime armi o ha limitazioni fisiche) e per questo è la scelta preferita da molte persone. In sintesi, per chi vuole massimizzare i miglioramenti della forma fisica, correre è la modalità più vantaggiosa, ma camminare resta un’attività salutare e più accessibile."

Tuttavia il contesto fornisce anche l’informazione contraria: «Susanna non ha ricevuto nessuna macchina fotografica». Questa affermazione rende il condizionale di Maria falso (la sua previsione non si è avverata).

**Risposta:**  
- **Secondo il ragionamento di Maria**: sì, Susanna avrebbe dovuto ricevere una macchina fotografica.  
- **Alla luce del fatto esplicito** che Susanna non ne ha ricevuta una, la previsione di Maria è falsa.

Da una proposizione condizionale possiamo usare il **contrapposto**:  
\( \neg R \rightarrow \neg P \) (se Paolo non riceve i 50 euro, allora non ha tagliato il prato).

Poiché sappiamo che \(\neg R\) è vero (Paolo non ha ricevuto i soldi), ne segue \(\neg P\): Paolo non ha tagliato il prato.  

Di conseguenza, la condizione per ricevere i 50 euro non si è verificata, e quindi **non è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro**."

Da una proposizione condizionale del tipo “se A, allora B” non possiamo dedurre B quando A è falso. Pertanto, non abbiamo alcuna informazione che Paolo abbia ricevuto i 50 euro; anzi, è ragionevole inferire che non li ha ricevuti.  

**Risposta:** No, non è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro."
S8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","No.  
Maria ha affermato solo una **condizione futura**: «Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio **leggerà** un libro».  
Poiché il cane è effettivamente in gioco, la condizione è soddisfatta, ma la frase non dichiara che Antonio abbia già letto il libro, bensì che lo farà. Pertanto, sulla base di quanto detto da Maria non possiamo affermare che Antonio **ha già letto** un libro."
S8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Antonio non ha letto nessun libro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","No.  
Il fatto che il cane stia giocando rende vera la premessa della frase di Maria (“Se il cane sta giocando…”), ma la sua affermazione è una **condizione futura**: “Antonio **leggerà** un libro”. Non implica che l’abbia già fatto. Inoltre, il contesto dichiara esplicitamente che “Antonio non ha letto nessun libro”. Perciò, in base a quanto dice Maria (e a quanto è affermato nel contesto), **non è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro**."

Maria ha affermato solo la condizione «Se il cane sta giocando, allora Antonio leggerà un libro».  
Poiché sappiamo che **il cane non sta giocando**, la premessa della condizione è falsa; da una proposizione del tipo “se P allora Q” non possiamo dedurre nulla su Q quando P è falsa.  

Quindi, con le informazioni a disposizione non possiamo affermare che Antonio abbia letto (o meno) un libro. La risposta è quindi **incerta / non dimostrabile**."
S9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No. Dalla frase di Maria sappiamo solo che, **se** il frigorifero è vuoto, allora **Anna porterà** delle ciambelle.  
Il frigorifero è effettivamente vuoto, quindi la condizione è soddisfatta e, secondo Maria, Anna le porterà.  

Tuttavia la frase è al futuro (“porterà”) e non ci dice nulla su ciò che è già accaduto. Perciò non possiamo affermare con certezza che **Anna abbia già portato** le ciambelle; possiamo solo dire che, secondo Maria, lo farà."
S9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è vero.

**Ragionamento**

1. **Premessa di Maria**  
   - Maria ha detto: «Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle».  
   - Questa è una proposizione condizionale del tipo *Se P allora Q* (P = “il frigorifero è vuoto”, Q = “Anna porta le ciambelle”).

2. **Fatti noti**  
   - Il frigorifero è effettivamente vuoto (P è vero).  
   - È stato affermato esplicitamente: «Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle» (¬Q è vero).  

3. **Valutazione della verità della conclusione**  
   - La condizionale di Maria stabilisce solo che, **se** il frigorifero è vuoto, **allora** ci si aspetta che Anna porti le ciambelle.  
   - Tuttavia, la realtà contraddice la conclusione della condizionale: Anna **non** le ha portate.  

4. **Conclusione**  
   - Pertanto, sulla base di tutti gli elementi forniti (in particolare l’affermazione che Anna non le ha portate), la risposta alla domanda «È vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?» è **no**.  

*Nota*: Se ci si limitasse esclusivamente alla sola frase di Maria, si potrebbe prevedere che Anna le avrebbe portate, ma l’informazione aggiuntiva «Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle» rende la previsione falsa nella realtà."
S9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è pieno. Inoltre, il forno è acceso. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No.  
Maria ha detto: «Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle».  
Il frigorifero **non** è vuoto (è pieno), quindi la condizione dell’«if» è falsa. Da una proposizione del tipo “Se P, allora Q” non si può dedurre Q quando P è falsa; al massimo la frase è considerata vera (in logica classica) perché il suo antecedente non si verifica, ma non implica che Q sia avvenuto.  

Quindi, in base a quanto ha detto Maria, non possiamo affermare che Anna abbia portato le ciambelle; non è vero (o, più precisamente, non è dimostrabile)."

María afirma: “Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno” ( J → P ).  
Sabemos que Juan **tiene hambre** (J es verdadero).

Ese enunciado es una condición: *si* (antecedente) ocurre, *entonces* (consecuente) ocurre.  

Como en el contexto se afirma que **Juan no tiene hambre**, el antecedente es falso. En lógica una implicación con antecedente falso es siempre verdadera, pero **no** permite concluir nada sobre el consecuente.

María sólo afirma que **si** a Noelia le doliera la cabeza, entonces habría aspirinas sobre la mesa. Como sabemos que a Noelia **no** le duele la cabeza, la condición de su enunciado es falsa; por lo tanto el antecedente del “si… entonces…” no se cumple y no podemos deducir nada acerca del consecuente.

Sabemos que Lucía **sí** tiene sed, pero **no** hay agua en la nevera.  

En lógica clásica, una condición “Si P entonces Q” es falsa precisamente cuando P es verdadera y Q es falsa. Por tanto la afirmación de María es falsa, y la conclusión “hay agua en la nevera” no es cierta.

Como el tiempo **sí** está lluvioso (el antecedente es verdadero), para que su afirmación sea verdadera el consecuente también tendría que ser verdadero, es decir, tendría que haber un paraguas en el paragüero.  

Sin embargo, el contexto indica que **no hay paraguas en el paragüero**. Por lo tanto, la condición que María plantea es falsa; en la realidad no hay paraguas allí.

En una implicación lógica, cuando el antecedente es falso la implicación completa es verdadera, pero **no nos permite concluir nada sobre el consecuente**. Por tanto, a partir de lo que dice María no podemos afirmar que haya (o no haya) una bomba de aire en el garaje.

**Razón:**  
María afirma la proposición condicional:

Como ella sostiene esa condición, dentro de su afirmación el consecuente \(Q\) (“hay un regador en la estantería”) debe ser verdadero cuando el antecedente \(P\) (“la planta está seca”) es verdadero. Por lo tanto, **según María** la conclusión es que sí existe un regador en la estantería.

*(En la realidad, según el contexto dado, no hay regador; por eso la afirmación de María es falsa. Pero la pregunta pide lo que María dice, no la verdad factual.)*"

Sabemos que la camisa **sí** está arrugada (premisa verdadera). Para que la condición de María sea verdadera, la conclusión «hay una plancha en el armario» tendría que ser cierta.  

Sin embargo, el contexto indica claramente que **no hay ninguna plancha en el armario**. Por lo tanto, la conclusión de María es falsa, y su enunciado condicional resulta falso.

S1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","Sí.  
María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza».  
Sabemos que **el loro está en la jaula** (premisa dada).  
Aplicando el razonamiento lógico del modus ponens ( Si P entonces Q; P es verdadera ⇒ Q es verdadera ), concluimos que **Tomás trajo pizza**, tal como María había afirmado."
S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","Sí.  
Según la condición que María dijo —«Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza»— y dado que el loro **está** en la jaula, el consecuente de la implicación debe cumplirse. Por lo tanto, **según lo que María afirmaba, Tomás trajo pizza**."
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No.  
María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza».  
Como el enunciado inicial afirma que **el loro no está en la jaula**, la condición «si el loro está en la jaula» es falsa.  

En lógica proposicional, una implicación “Si P entonces Q” solo garantiza que Q sea verdadera cuando P es verdadera; cuando P es falsa, la implicación es vacuamente verdadera, pero **no obliga a que Q sea verdadera**.  

Por lo tanto, a partir de lo que dijo María no podemos concluir que Tomás haya traído pizza; simplemente no hay información que lo confirme. En consecuencia, **no es verdad (o no se puede afirmar) que Tomás trajo pizza**."
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Sí, **según lo que dijo María** y asumiendo que su afirmación es cierta, al haberte comido el brócoli se cumple la condición de su frase «Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo». Por lo tanto, bajo esa premisa, **Marcos te habría dado el caramelo**. (Esto depende de que la condición expresada por María sea verdadera y de que ella no haya mentido.)"
S2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. Marcos no te dio un caramelo. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Según la condición que María dijo –«Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo»– el antecedente se cumple (te comiste el brócoli). Por lo tanto, para que la afirmación de María sea verdadera, el consecuente también tiene que ser verdadero: **Marcos te habría dado un caramelo**.  

En la información dada se indica que “Marcos no te dio un caramelo”, lo que entra en contradicción con lo que María afirmó. Pero la pregunta pide responder “según lo que decía María”.  

**Respuesta:** Sí, según lo que María decía, Marcos te dio (o debería haberte dado) un caramelo."
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No. Según la condición que María estableció —«Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo»— el caramelo solo se entrega en el caso de que **te comas el brócoli**.

S3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No. Según la información proporcionada sólo se afirma que, si los zorros están bailando, **Irene** recibirá una cámara. No se menciona a Susana en ninguna premisa ni conclusión, por lo que no hay base para afirmar que ella haya recibido una cámara. En consecuencia, la afirmación “Susana recibió una cámara” no es verdadera (no se puede deducir)."

S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No. Según la información disponible sólo sabemos que los zorros no están bailando y que, por tanto, la condición «si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara» no se activa. No hay ninguna premisa que relacione a Susana con la cámara, así que no se puede afirmar que ella la haya recibido. En consecuencia, la afirmación «Susana recibió una cámara» no es verdadera (no se puede demostrar)."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí. Como la televisión está encendida y María afirmó que “si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas”, entonces, según su afirmación, Mateo hizo galletas."

María dijo: «Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas».  
Como en el contexto la televisión **está encendida**, el antecedente de la condición es verdadero; por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, el consecuente también debe ser verdadero: **Mateo habría hecho (o hará) galletas**.  

Así que, según lo que María decía, es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No.  
María sólo dijo una condición: **«Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas»**.  
Como en el contexto la televisión está **apagada**, la condición no se cumple. En lógica proposicional una implicación con antecedente falso no nos permite concluir nada sobre el consecuente; simplemente la afirmación «si P entonces Q» sigue siendo verdadera, pero no implica que Q sea verdadero.

Por lo tanto, a partir de lo que dijo María no podemos afirmar que Mateo haya hecho galletas; su realización queda indeterminada."
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Sí. Según la condición que María expresó —«Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado»— y dado que hoy el tiempo está efectivamente soleado, se deduce que Emma fue de morado (asumiendo que la afirmación de María es cierta)."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No.  
Aunque María había dicho «Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado», la premisa de su condición (el tiempo está soleado) es cierta, pero el consecuente no se cumple: **Emma fue de verde**, no de morado. Por lo tanto, la afirmación de que Emma fue de morado es falsa."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No. La afirmación de María es una condición: *«Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado»*. Como hoy el tiempo está lluvioso (y no soleado), la condición no se cumple, por lo que no podemos afirmar que Emma haya ido de morado. En consecuencia, **no es verdad que Emma fuera de morado** basándonos en lo que decía María."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí. Según la afirmación de María —«Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie»— y dado que el parque está vacío, la condición se cumple; por lo tanto, de acuerdo con lo que María decía, Júlia se hará (se hizo) un selfie."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No.  

María dijo: «Si el parque infantil está vacío, **Júlia se hará un selfie**».  
El antecedente de esa condición (el parque está vacío) es **verdadero**, pero sabemos que **Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie**.  

En una implicación lógica “Si P entonces Q”, cuando P es verdadero y Q es falso la implicación es **falsa**. Por tanto, la afirmación de María es incorrecta y, en la realidad, **Júlia no se hizo un selfie**."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No.  
María dijo: **«Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie»**.  
Ese enunciado es una condición del tipo *si P entonces Q*.  

- **P** = “el parque infantil está vacío”.  
- **Q** = “Júlia se hará un selfie”.

En la situación descrita sabemos que **el parque infantil está lleno**, es decir, **P es falso**.  

En lógica proposicional, cuando el antecedente (*P*) de una implicación es falso, la implicación completa (*P → Q*) es verdadera *pero* no nos dice nada sobre la verdad de *Q*. En otras palabras, el hecho de que el parque no esté vacío no permite concluir que Júlia haya (o no haya) tomado el selfie.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos afirmar que Júlia se haya hecho un selfie**; la información disponible no lo confirma ni lo descarta."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No. Aunque el césped está cortado, el enunciado no indica quién lo hizo. La condición de María solo garantiza los 50 euros **si** Pablo es quien corta el césped; al no saber si él fue el responsable, no podemos afirmar que haya recibido el dinero.

Ese enunciado es una condición: **solo** si Pablo corta el césped se le pagará el dinero.  

En el contexto se indica que *el césped no ha sido cortado*. Por lo tanto la condición no se cumplió, y no hay razón para afirmar que Pablo haya recibido los 50 euros.  

En lógica formal, la proposición “Si P entonces Q” es verdadera cuando **P** es falsa, pero eso no implica que **Q** sea verdadera. Así que, según lo que decía María y los hechos descritos, no podemos decir que Pablo recibió 50 euros."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Según la condición que María formuló –«Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro»– y dado que, efectivamente, **el perro está jugando**, la conclusión lógica es que **Antonio leerá** (o debería leer) un libro.  

Sin embargo, la frase de María habla de una acción futura («leerá»), y el enunciado de la pregunta se refiere al pasado («leyó»). Con la información disponible sólo podemos inferir que Antonio **debería** leer un libro, no que ya lo haya hecho.  

**Por lo tanto, no podemos afirmar que Antonio ya haya leído un libro; sólo podemos decir que, según lo que dijo María, se espera que lo lea.**"

Por lo tanto, **de acuerdo con lo que decía María, la afirmación “Antonio leyó un libro” sería verdadera**.  

Sin embargo, el relato también indica que “Antonio no leyó ningún libro”, de modo que la premisa de María no se corresponde con la realidad descrita. En la lógica formal, la condición de María sería falsa (o al menos no cumplida) porque su consecuencia no se verifica, pero la pregunta pide juzgar **según lo que María decía**, y bajo esa perspectiva la respuesta es **sí**."
