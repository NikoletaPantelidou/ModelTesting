B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.  
Mary says: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""*  
We are told that **John is hungry**, so the condition is met.  
Therefore, according to Mary's statement, **there is pizza in the oven** — and this aligns with the context provided."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is **not true** that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary says: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P: John is hungry  
- Q: There is pizza in the oven  

We are told that **John is hungry (P is true)**, but **there is no pizza in the oven (Q is false)**.  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says and the given facts, her statement is **false**, and **there is no pizza in the oven**."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""* This only tells us what would be the case **if** John were hungry. Since we know **John is not hungry**, the condition is not met, and the statement gives us no information about whether there is pizza in the oven or not."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is **not true** that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary says: *""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = Nicole's head hurts  
- Q = There is aspirin on the table  

We are told that **Nicole's head hurts** (P is true), but **there is no aspirin on the table** (Q is false).  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says, the claim that there is aspirin on the table is **false**."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If Nicole's head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.""* Since Nicole's head **does not** hurt (as stated in the context), the condition in the ""if"" part is **false**. In logic, a conditional statement (""If P, then Q"") is considered **true** when the condition (P) is false, regardless of whether Q is true or false. This is called a **vacuous truth**.

So, based solely on what Mary says and the fact that Nicole's head does **not** hurt, we **cannot conclude** whether or not there is aspirin on the table."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, it is true that there is water in the fridge."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is **not true** that there is water in the fridge.

Mary says: *""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""Lucy is thirsty""  
- Q = ""There is water in the fridge""

We are told that **Lucy is thirsty** (P is true), but **there is no water in the fridge** (Q is false).  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says, the claim that there is water in the fridge is **not supported**—in fact, it's contradicted by the facts."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: *""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""* This only tells us what **would** be true **if** Lucy were thirsty. But since **Lucy is not thirsty**, the condition is **not met**, and the statement gives us **no information** about whether there is or isn't water in the fridge."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is **not true** that there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary says: *""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If A, then B**, where  
- A = Peter's phone is dead  
- B = There is a charger in the drawer  

We are told that **Peter's phone is dead (A is true)**, but **there is no charger in the drawer (B is false)**.  
This means the conditional statement **""If A, then B""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says, and given the actual situation, her statement is **false**, and therefore **it is not true** that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""* This only tells us what would be the case **if** Peter's phone were dead. Since Peter's phone is **fully charged**, the condition is not met, so the statement gives us no information about whether there actually is a charger in the drawer."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is **not true** that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is: *""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""*  
This is a conditional statement of the form: *If P, then Q*, where  
- P: ""The weather is rainy""  
- Q: ""There is an umbrella on the coat rack""

In logic, a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false. In this case, the weather **is** rainy (P is true), but there is **no** umbrella on the coat rack (Q is false). Therefore, Mary's statement is **false** in this situation.

So, based on the actual facts, **there is no umbrella on the coat rack**, despite what Mary says."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""* This only tells us what happens **if** it is rainy. Since the weather is **sunny**, the condition is not met, so we cannot conclude anything about whether there is or isn't an umbrella on the coat rack."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, it is true that there is a pump in the garage — both according to what Mary says and as stated in the context."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is a pump in the garage.

Mary says: *""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.""* This is a conditional statement — it only guarantees a pump in the garage **if** your tire is flat. But in this context, your tire **is** flat, and **there is no pump in the garage**. So Mary's statement is **false** in this case."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a pump in the garage. Mary only says that **if** your tire is flat, **then** there is a pump in the garage. Since your tire is **not** flat, her statement doesn't confirm whether the pump is actually in the garage or not."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is **not true** that there is a water can on the shelf.

Mary says: *""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.""*  
But the context tells us **the plant is dry**, and **there is no water can on the shelf**.

This means Mary's statement is **false** in this situation."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If the plant is dry, then there is a water can on the shelf.""* Since the plant is **not dry**, the condition is **not met**, so the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the water can is on the shelf or not."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.  
Mary's statement — ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"" — is a conditional. Since George's shirt **is** wrinkled (as stated in the context), the condition is met, and therefore the conclusion — ""there is an iron in the closet"" — must be true based on what Mary says."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is **not true** that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary says: *""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""George's shirt is wrinkled""  
- Q = ""There is an iron in the closet""

We are told that **George's shirt is wrinkled**, so P is **true**.  
But we are also told that **there is no iron in the closet**, so Q is **false**.

Therefore, Mary's statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.  
So, based on what Mary says, **it is not true** that there is an iron in the closet — in fact, the opposite is true."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: *""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet.""*  
But George's shirt is **not wrinkled**, so the condition is **false**. In logic, a conditional statement is only false when the condition is true and the conclusion is false. Here, since the condition is false, the statement gives **no information** about whether there is an iron in the closet.

So, based solely on what Mary says and the fact that George's shirt is not wrinkled, we **cannot determine** whether there is an iron in the closet."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf. Mary states, ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf,"" and the context confirms that Susy wants to read and that books are indeed on the shelf."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is **not true** that there are books on the shelf.

Mary says: *""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf.""* This is a conditional statement — it only guarantees books **if** Susy wants to read. But the context tells us that **Susy wants to read**, and **there are no books on the shelf**. So the condition in Mary's statement is met, but the result (books on the shelf) is false. Therefore, Mary's statement is **false** in this context."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.  
Mary's statement — ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"" — implies that books are available on the shelf for reading, regardless of whether Susy actually wants to read."

In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","No. The context only says that “most people prefer green tea,” not that they actually consume more of it. Since the only drink mentioned as being present is black coffee, we cannot conclude that green tea is more used."

F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Yes, in this context, soda appears to be more in demand than water, since many people choose soda even though water is healthier and available."
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","No. In this context people still pick soda even though water is healthier, so soda is the item in higher demand."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"" — and given that the parrot **is** in the cage, **it follows logically** that Thomas brought pizza.

So, **yes**, it is true that Thomas brought pizza."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Mary said: *""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""*  
The parrot **is** in the cage, so according to Mary's statement, Thomas **should** have brought pizza.  
However, the context also states that **Thomas did not bring pizza**.

This means Mary's statement turned out to be **false** — the condition was met, but the outcome did not happen."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Mary said: *""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where:
- P = ""the parrot is in the cage""
- Q = ""Thomas will bring pizza""

We are told that **the parrot is not in the cage**, so P is **false**.

In logic, **if the condition (P) is false, the entire conditional statement is considered true regardless of whether Q is true or false**.  
So, **we cannot conclude anything about whether Thomas brought pizza** based solely on this statement and the fact that the parrot is not in the cage.

**Answer: It is not true (nor false) that Thomas brought pizza — we simply don't know.**"
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy. Mary said *if* you finish your broccoli, Mark *will* give you a candy — but that doesn't confirm that Mark actually did. It only sets up a condition, not a guarantee that the reward was delivered."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy.

Mary said: *""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""*  
You finished your broccoli, but Mary did **not** give you a candy. However, the statement only says **Mark** will give you a candy — it doesn't say **when**, and it doesn't say Mary would give it to you. So unless Mark actually handed you a candy, we **cannot conclude** that Mark gave you one.

So, based **only** on what Mary said and the fact that you finished your broccoli, **we do not know** whether Mark gave you a candy."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy.  
Since you didn’t finish your broccoli, the condition Mary stated was not met."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera — based on what Mary said, since the foxes are dancing, the condition is met."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that Susan got a camera.

Mary said: *""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where:
- P = ""the foxes are dancing""
- Q = ""Susan will get a camera""

We are told that **the foxes are dancing**, so P is **true**.  
However, we are **not told** whether Susan got a camera — only that she **did not get a shovel**, which doesn't confirm or deny whether she got a camera.

So, based **only** on what Mary said and the given context, we **cannot conclude** that Susan got a camera. The statement only tells us what **should** happen if the foxes are dancing, not that it **did** happen."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is not true that Susan got a camera.

Mary said: *""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""*  
But the context states: *""The foxes are not dancing.""*  

Since the condition (foxes dancing) is **not** met, the statement does **not** guarantee that Susan got a camera. Therefore, based on what Mary said and the given context, we **cannot** conclude that Susan got a camera."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes, it is true that Matthew baked cookies — based on what Mary said. She stated: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""* Since the TV **is** on, the condition is met, so according to her statement, Matthew baked cookies."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is **not true** that Matthew baked cookies.

Mary said: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""The TV is on""  
- Q = ""Matthew will bake cookies""

In logic, the only way this statement is proven false is if **P is true and Q is false** — that is, if the TV is on **and** Matthew **did not** bake cookies.

In this case, the TV **is** on (P is true), and Matthew **did not** bake cookies (Q is false).  
So, Mary's statement is **false**, but more importantly, **Matthew did not bake cookies**, so the answer to the question is:

**No, Matthew did not bake cookies.**"
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.  
Since the TV is off, the condition Mary stated (""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"") is not met, so we cannot conclude that Matthew baked cookies."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"" — and given that the weather **is** sunny, it logically follows that **Emma wore purple**, assuming Mary’s statement is true."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not true that Emma wore purple.  
Mary said: *""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""*  
The weather **is** sunny, but Emma is wearing **green**, not purple.  
So, Mary's statement turned out to be **false** in this case."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not true that Emma wore purple.  
Mary said Emma would wear purple **only if** the weather is sunny. Since the weather is rainy (not sunny), the condition for Emma wearing purple is not met."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"" — and given that the playground **is** empty, it logically follows that **Angela took a selfie**.

So yes, **it is true** that Angela took a selfie, **according to Mary's statement**."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is **not true** that Angela took a selfie.

Mary said: *""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""the playground is empty""  
- Q = ""Angela will take a selfie""

We are told that **the playground is empty (P is true)**, but **Angela did not take a selfie (Q is false)**.

This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.  
So, based on what Mary says, **Angela should have taken a selfie**, but **she didn’t** — so **Mary’s statement is false**, and **Angela did not take a selfie**."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.

Mary said: *""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""*  
But the context states that *the playground is crowded*, so the condition for Angela taking a selfie (the playground being empty) was **not** met. Therefore, based on what Mary said, Angela **did not** take a selfie."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","We don't know for sure.  
Mary’s statement only says Paul *will* get 50 euros **if** he mows the lawn.  
The context tells us the lawn has been mowed, but it never says **who** mowed it.  
Therefore, we cannot conclude that Paul got the 50 euros."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.  
Mary said: *""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""*  
While the lawn has been mowed, we are told **Paul did not get 50 euros**.  
This implies that either Paul did **not** mow the lawn (someone else did), or Mary did not fulfill her promise — but based solely on the given information, **Paul did not receive the 50 euros**, so the statement ""Paul got 50 euros"" is **false**."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.  
Since the lawn has not been mowed, the condition Mary set—""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros""—has not been met."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"".

S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is **not true** that Anthony read a book.

Mary said: *""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""*  
The dog **is** playing, so according to Mary's statement, Anthony **should** have read a book.  
However, the context also states that **Anthony did not read a book**.

This means Mary's statement turned out to be **false** — the condition was met (dog playing), but the outcome (Anthony reading) did not happen."
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not true that Anthony read a book.

Mary said: *""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""*  
But the dog is **not** playing. Since the condition (dog playing) is **false**, the statement doesn't guarantee anything about Anthony reading a book. So, we **cannot conclude** that Anthony read a book."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"" — and given that the fridge **is** empty, it logically follows that **Amy will bring donuts**.

However, the statement only tells us what **will** happen under that condition, not whether it **already** happened. So, we **cannot say for sure** that Amy **already brought** donuts — only that she **should** or **is expected to**.

**Answer: It is not necessarily true that Amy brought donuts — only that she is expected to.**"
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No, it is **not true** that Amy brought donuts.

Mary said: *""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""*  
The fridge **is** empty, so the condition is met.  
However, **Amy did not bring donuts**, which contradicts what Mary said.

So, based on what Mary said, **Amy should have brought donuts**, but **she didn’t**, making the statement **false** in this case."
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No, it is not true that Amy brought donuts.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","No, non è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro.  
Maria aveva detto: *""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro""*. Questa è una promessa condizionale: **solo se Paolo taglia il prato**, allora riceverà i 50 euro.  

Nel contesto però si dice chiaramente: **""Il prato è stato tagliato""**, ma **""Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro""**. Questo implica che, anche se il prato è stato tagliato, **non è stato Paolo a farlo** (o che Maria non ha mantenuto la promessa, ma non c'è evidenza di questo).  

Quindi, **Paolo non ha ricevuto i 50 euro**, e questo è coerente con la promessa di Maria: se non ha tagliato lui il prato, non ha diritto al pagamento."

Maria aveva detto che **se** Paolo tagliava il prato, **allora** avrebbe ricevuto 50 euro. Ma il prato **non è stato tagliato**, quindi la condizione non si è verificata."

Maria ha detto: *""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro.""*

Nel contesto sappiamo che:
- Il cane **sta giocando** → A è **vero**
- Antonio **non ha letto nessun libro** → B è **falso**

Quindi la condizione ""se A, allora B"" risulta **falsa**, perché A è vero ma B è falso. Tuttavia, questo non cambia il fatto che **Antonio non ha letto un libro**, come esplicitamente detto nel contesto.

Por tanto, la afirmación de María no nos permite concluir nada sobre si Tomás trajo pizza o no. Es decir, **no se puede afirmar que Tomás trajo pizza** basándose en lo que dijo María."
