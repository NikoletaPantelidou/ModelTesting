B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.  
Mary's statement — ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"" — is a conditional. Since we are told that John **is** hungry, the condition is met, and therefore the consequence (""there is pizza in the oven"") must be true based on what Mary says."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is **not true** that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary says: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P: John is hungry  
- Q: There is pizza in the oven  

We are told that **John is hungry (P is true)**, but **there is no pizza in the oven (Q is false)**.  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says and the facts given, **her statement is false**, and **there is no pizza in the oven**."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""* This only tells us what would be the case **if** John were hungry. Since we know **John is not hungry**, the condition is not met, and the statement gives us no information about whether there is pizza in the oven or not."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is **not true** that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary says: *""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = Nicole's head hurts  
- Q = There is aspirin on the table  

We are told that **Nicole's head hurts** (P is true), but **there is no aspirin on the table** (Q is false).  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on what Mary says, the claim that there is aspirin on the table is **false**."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If Nicole's head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.""* This only tells us what would be the case **if** Nicole's head hurt. But since **Nicole's head does not hurt**, the condition is **not met**, and the statement gives us **no information** about whether aspirin is on the table or not."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, it is true that there is water in the fridge — both the context and Mary's statement confirm it."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is **not true** that there is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement — *""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge""* — is a conditional. It only tells us what **would** be the case **if** Lucy is thirsty. But we already know from the context that **Lucy is thirsty**, and **there is no water in the fridge**. This directly contradicts the consequence of Mary's conditional, making her statement **false** in this situation."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: *""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""*  
Since **Lucy is not thirsty**, the condition is **not met**, so the statement gives **no information** about whether there is water in the fridge."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is **not true** that there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary says: *""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = Peter's phone is dead  
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer  

We are told that **Peter's phone is dead (P is true)**, but **there is no charger in the drawer (Q is false)**.  

So the statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.  
Therefore, based on what Mary says, **her statement is false**, and **there is no charger in the drawer**."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""* Since Peter's phone is **fully charged**, the condition (""Peter's phone is dead"") is **false**. In logic, a conditional statement with a false antecedent is considered **vacuously true**, but it doesn't provide any information about the truth of the consequent (""there is a charger in the drawer"").

So, based solely on Mary's statement and the fact that Peter's phone is charged, we **cannot conclude** whether or not there is a charger in the drawer."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is **not true** that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement — *""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""* — is a conditional. In logic, this is of the form:  
**If P, then Q**, where:  
- P = ""the weather is rainy""  
- Q = ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack""

We are told that **P is true** (it is rainy), but **Q is false** (there is **no** umbrella on the coat rack).  
This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.

So, based on the facts, **there is no umbrella on the coat rack**, and Mary's statement is **not supported** by the current situation."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""* This only tells us what happens **if** it is rainy. Since the weather is **sunny**, the condition is not met, so we cannot conclude anything about whether there is or isn't an umbrella on the coat rack based solely on her statement."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, it is true that there is a pump in the garage."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is **not true** that there is a pump in the garage.

Mary says: *""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""your tire is flat""  
- Q = ""there is a pump in the garage""

In logic, a conditional statement is **only false** when P is true and Q is false.  
Here, P is true (your tire **is** flat), but Q is false (there is **no** pump in the garage).  
So Mary's statement is **false** in this case — meaning **there is no pump in the garage**, contrary to what she claims."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a pump in the garage. Mary only says that *if* your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage. Since your tire is **not** flat, her statement doesn't confirm whether the pump is actually there."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is **not true** that there is a water can on the shelf.

Mary says: *""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P (plant is dry), then Q (water can is on the shelf).**

In logic, a conditional statement is only false when the **antecedent (P)** is true and the **consequent (Q)** is false.

Here, the **plant is dry (P is true)**, but **there is no water can on the shelf (Q is false)**.  
So, Mary's statement is **false** in this context.

Therefore, based on what Mary says and the actual situation, **there is no water can on the shelf**, and her claim is contradicted."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not necessarily true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Mary's statement is a conditional: *""If the plant is dry, then there is a water can on the shelf.""* Since the plant is **not dry**, the condition is **not met**, so the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the water can is on the shelf or not."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.  
Mary's statement — ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"" — is a conditional. Since George's shirt **is** wrinkled (as stated in the context), the condition is met, and therefore the conclusion — ""there is an iron in the closet"" — must be true based on what Mary says."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is **not true** that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is: *""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""*  
This is a conditional statement of the form: *If P, then Q*, where  
- P: George's shirt is wrinkled  
- Q: There is an iron in the closet

We are told that **George's shirt is wrinkled** (P is true), but **there is no iron in the closet** (Q is false).  
So, the conditional *If P, then Q* is **false** in this case.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, the claim that ""there is an iron in the closet"" is **false**."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: *""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet.""* Since George's shirt is **not wrinkled**, the condition is **false**, and the statement gives **no information** about whether there is or isn't an iron in the closet. So, we **cannot conclude** anything about the iron's location based solely on what Mary says."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf. Mary states, ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf,"" and the context confirms that Susy wants to read and that books are indeed on the shelf."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is **not true** that there are books on the shelf.

Mary says: *""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""Susy wants to read""  
- Q = ""There are books on the shelf""

From the context, we know **Susy wants to read** (P is true), but **there are no books on the shelf** (Q is false).  
So the statement ""If P, then Q"" is **false** in this case.

Therefore, based on what Mary says and the actual situation, **it is not true** that there are books on the shelf."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.  
Mary's statement — ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"" — implies that books are available on the shelf for reading, regardless of whether Susy actually wants to read."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"" — and given that the parrot **is** in the cage, **it follows** that Thomas **should** bring pizza.

However, the statement only tells us what **will** happen under that condition. It doesn't confirm **whether** Thomas actually brought pizza — only that he **should** have.

**Answer:** We can conclude that Thomas **should** bring pizza, but we **cannot confirm** from the given information that he **did**."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Mary said: *""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""*  
The parrot **is** in the cage, but Thomas **did not** bring pizza.  
This means the condition was met, but the outcome did not happen — so Mary's statement turned out to be **false**."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Mary said: *""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""*  
This is a conditional statement — it only guarantees pizza **if** the parrot is in the cage.

But we are told: *The parrot is **not** in the cage.*  
So the condition was **not met**, and therefore, **nothing can be concluded** about whether Thomas brought pizza. He **might** have, but **not because of** what Mary said."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy. Mary said *""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy,""* but she didn't say that Mark *did* give you a candy—only that he *would*. Since the statement doesn't confirm that Mark actually followed through, we can't say for sure that he gave you one."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy. Mary said *Mark* would give you a candy *if* you finished your broccoli, but she didn't say *she* would give you one. Since Mary did not give you a candy, and there's no information about Mark actually giving you one, we can't conclude that Mark did."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy.  
Since you didn’t finish your broccoli, the condition Mary stated was not met."

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera — based on what Mary said and the fact that the foxes are dancing."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that Susan got a camera.

Mary said: *""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""*  
We are told that **the foxes are dancing**, so the condition is met.  
However, we are **not told** whether Susan actually got a camera — only that the condition for her to get one is satisfied.  
So, based **only** on what Mary says and the given context, we **cannot conclude** that Susan got a camera — only that she **should** have."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is not true that Susan got a camera.

Mary said: *""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""* This is a conditional statement — it only guarantees that Susan will get a camera **if** the foxes are dancing. But in the context, it's stated that **the foxes are not dancing**. Since the condition (foxes dancing) is not met, the statement doesn't guarantee anything about Susan getting a camera. Therefore, we **cannot conclude** that Susan got a camera."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes, it is true that Matthew baked cookies — based on what Mary said. She stated: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""* Since the TV **is** on, the condition is met, so according to her statement, Matthew baked cookies."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is **not true** that Matthew baked cookies.

Mary said: *""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""The TV is on""  
- Q = ""Matthew will bake cookies""

In logic, the only way this statement is proven false is if **P is true and Q is false** — that is, if the TV is on **and** Matthew **did not** bake cookies.

In this case, the TV **is** on (P is true), and Matthew **did not** bake cookies (Q is false).  
So, Mary's statement is **false**, but that doesn't change the fact that **Matthew did not bake cookies**.

**Conclusion:** It is **not true** that Matthew baked cookies."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.  
Since the TV is off, the condition in Mary's statement (""If the TV is on..."") is not met, so we cannot conclude that Matthew baked cookies."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"" — and given that the weather **is** sunny, it **follows** that Emma **will** wear purple.

So yes, **it is true** that Emma wore purple, **according to Mary's statement**."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is **not true** that Emma wore purple. According to the context, Emma is wearing **green**, even though the weather is sunny. This contradicts Mary's statement that ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple."""
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not true that Emma wore purple.  
Mary said, *""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""*  
Since the weather is **rainy**, not sunny, the condition for Emma wearing purple is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Emma wore purple."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"" — and given that the playground **is** empty, it logically follows that **Angela will take a selfie**.

However, the statement only tells us what **will** happen under that condition, not that it **already** happened. So, we can conclude that **Angela is expected to take a selfie**, but we **cannot definitively say** that she **already has** taken one based solely on this information."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is **not true** that Angela took a selfie.

Mary said: *""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""*  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = ""the playground is empty""  
- Q = ""Angela will take a selfie""

We are told that **the playground is empty (P is true)**, but **Angela did not take a selfie (Q is false)**.

This means the conditional statement **""If P, then Q""** is **false** in this case.  
So, based on what Mary says, **Angela should have taken a selfie**, but **she didn’t** — so **Mary’s statement is false**, and **Angela did not take a selfie**."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.  
Mary said Angela would take a selfie *only if* the playground is empty — but the playground is *crowded*, so the condition for Angela to take a selfie was not met."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","We don't know for sure.  
Mary’s statement only says Paul *will* get 50 euros **if** he mows the lawn.  
The context tells us the lawn has been mowed, but it never says **who** mowed it.  
Therefore, we cannot conclude that Paul got the 50 euros."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.  
Mary said: *""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""*  
The lawn has been mowed, but Paul did **not** get 50 euros.  
This means either Paul did **not** mow the lawn (someone else did), or Mary did not keep her promise.  
Since the statement is a conditional (""if... then...""), the only way for it to be false is if Paul mowed the lawn **and** did **not** get 50 euros.  
But we are told **Paul did not get 50 euros**, and the lawn **was** mowed.  
So we **cannot** conclude that Paul got 50 euros — in fact, we can conclude he **did not**."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.  
Since the lawn has not been mowed, the condition Mary set—""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros""—has not been met."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Yes, it is true that Anthony read a book — based on what Mary said. She stated: *""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""* Since the dog **is** playing, the condition is met, so Anthony **did** read a book."
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is **not true** that Anthony read a book.

Mary said: *""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""*  
We know the **dog is playing**, so according to Mary's statement, Anthony **should** read a book.  
But the context also says: **Anthony did not read a book**.

So, Mary's statement turned out to be **false** — the condition was met (dog playing), but the outcome (Anthony reading) did **not** happen."
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not true that Anthony read a book.

Mary said: *""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""*  
But the dog is **not** playing. Since the condition (the dog playing) is **not** met, the statement doesn't guarantee that Anthony read a book. So, based on what Mary said, we **cannot** conclude that Anthony read a book."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"" — and given that the fridge **is** empty, it logically follows that **Amy will bring donuts**.

However, the statement only tells us what **will** happen under that condition, not whether it **already** happened. So, we **cannot say for sure** that Amy **already brought** donuts — only that she **should** or **is expected to**.

**Answer: It is not necessarily true that Amy brought donuts — only that she is expected to.**"
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No, it is **not true** that Amy brought donuts.

Mary said: *""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""*  
The fridge **is** empty, so according to Mary's statement, Amy **should** have brought donuts.  
However, the context also says: **""Amy did not bring donuts.""**

So, while Mary's statement implies Amy **would** bring donuts, the actual outcome contradicts that. Therefore, **Amy did not bring donuts**, making the implication in Mary's statement **false** in this case."
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No, it is not true that Amy brought donuts.  
Mary said, *""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""*  
Since the fridge is **full**, the condition for Amy bringing donuts is **not met**."
