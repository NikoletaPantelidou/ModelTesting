B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, based on what Mary says, **it is true that there is pizza in the oven** — *but only if John is hungry*.

Mary’s statement is:  
> **“If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.”**

This is a **conditional statement** (if P, then Q), where:  
- P = John is hungry  
- Q = There is pizza in the oven

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false only when P is true and Q is false**. In all other cases (including when P is false), the statement is considered true.

But here’s the key: **We are told in the context that John *is* hungry.** So P is true.

Therefore, for Mary’s statement to be true (and we are to assume she is making a truthful statement), Q must also be true — **there must be pizza in the oven**.

✅ So, **yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven**, based on Mary’s statement and the fact that John is hungry.

*(Note: The pasta in the fridge is irrelevant to the logic of Mary’s conditional statement.)*"
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is **not true** that there is pizza in the oven.

Here’s why:

Mary says:  
> **“If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = John is hungry  
- Q = There is pizza in the oven

We are told:  
- John **is** hungry → P is **true**  
- There is **no** pizza in the oven → Q is **false**

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false** only when P is true and Q is false.  
In all other cases, it’s true.

So here, since P is true and Q is false, **Mary’s statement is false**.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that there is pizza in the oven?**

Based on the context:  
> “There is no pizza in the oven.”

So regardless of Mary’s statement, the **actual state of the world** is that **there is no pizza in the oven**.

Even if we were to evaluate based *only* on Mary’s statement and the fact that John is hungry, the conditional would be **violated**, meaning Mary’s claim is incorrect — which again implies that **there is no pizza in the oven**, contradicting her statement.

✅ Final Answer: **No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven.**"
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary says:  
> **“If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.”**

This is a **conditional statement** (an “if-then” statement):  
**If P, then Q**,  
where:  
- P = John is hungry  
- Q = There is pizza in the oven

We are told:  
> **John is not hungry.**

In logic, when the **antecedent (P)** of a conditional is **false**, the entire conditional statement is considered **true regardless of the consequent (Q)**. This is called **vacuous truth**.

But — and this is key — **the truth of the conditional does not tell us whether Q is actually true or false**. It only tells us that **if** John were hungry, then there would be pizza. Since he’s not hungry, the statement doesn’t give us any information about whether pizza is actually in the oven.

So, based **only** on Mary’s statement and the fact that John is not hungry, we **cannot conclude** that there is pizza in the oven.

✅ Final Answer: **No, we cannot determine that there is pizza in the oven based on Mary’s statement.**"
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary says: *“If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.”*

This is a conditional statement:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = Nicole’s head hurts  
- Q = There is aspirin on the table

Since P is true (Nicole’s head hurts), and Mary asserts that **if P then Q**, we can logically conclude that **Q is true** — *there is aspirin on the table* — assuming Mary’s statement is true.

Additionally, the context independently confirms that *there is aspirin on the table*, so even without relying solely on Mary’s statement, the fact is corroborated.

✅ Therefore, **yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.**"
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either.

We are told in the context that:  
- Nicole’s head **does** hurt (P is true)  
- There is **no** aspirin on the table (Q is false)

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false** only when P is true and Q is false — which is **exactly** the case here.

So, Mary’s statement is **false**.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that there is aspirin on the table?**

Based on the context — **“there is no aspirin on the table”** — the answer is clearly **no**.

Mary’s statement is incorrect, but that doesn’t change the factual state of the world: **there is no aspirin on the table**.

B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"".

Mary says: **“If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.”**

We are also told in the context that **Lucy is thirsty**.

This creates a conditional statement:

And we are told P is true (Lucy is thirsty).  
In classical logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true.

Therefore, **there is water in the fridge** — this follows logically from Mary’s statement and the given context.

B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table.

This is a **conditional statement** (if P, then Q), where:  
- P = Peter’s phone is dead  
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer

We are told in the context that **Peter’s phone is dead** — so the *antecedent (P)* is true.

In classical logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true (this is called *modus ponens*).

So, **if we accept Mary’s statement as true**, then since Peter’s phone is dead, it logically follows that **there is a charger in the drawer**.

✅ Therefore, **yes — it is true that there is a charger in the drawer**, assuming Mary’s statement is true.

- P = Peter’s phone is dead  
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer

But we are told:  
**Peter’s phone is fully charged** → So P is **false**.

In logic, when the premise (P) of a conditional is false, the entire conditional statement is considered **true regardless of the truth of Q**. That is, “If false, then anything” is logically true.

However, **this does not tell us whether Q is actually true** — we cannot infer the truth of the conclusion (there is a charger in the drawer) from a false premise.

So, based *only* on Mary’s statement and the fact that Peter’s phone is fully charged, **we do not have enough information to determine whether there is a charger in the drawer**.

Mary says:  
> “If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack.”

This is a **conditional statement** (if P, then Q). It only tells us what happens **if** the weather is rainy. It says nothing about what happens when the weather is **not** rainy.

In the context, the weather is **sunny**, so the condition (“if the weather is rainy”) is **false**. In logic, when the premise of a conditional is false, the entire conditional is considered **true**, regardless of the conclusion — but that doesn’t mean the conclusion is true in reality.

In other words:  
- Mary’s statement doesn’t guarantee the umbrella exists when it’s sunny.  
- It only guarantees the umbrella exists **if** it’s raining.  
- Since it’s sunny, we have no information about whether the umbrella is there or not.

**Therefore, based on Mary’s statement and the sunny weather, we cannot conclude that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.**

B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is a pump in the garage.

Mary says: **“If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.”**

This is a conditional statement:

Where:  
- P = “Your tire is flat”  
- Q = “There is a pump in the garage”

In the context, we are told:  
> “Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage.”

So, **P is true** (tire is flat), and **Q is also true** (pump is in the garage).

Mary’s statement is **“If P, then Q”** — and since both P and Q are true, the conditional statement holds true.

Moreover, even if we didn’t know Q independently, Mary’s statement — combined with the fact that P is true — would logically imply Q must be true for the conditional to hold (assuming Mary is telling the truth).

But in this case, we are also directly told that “there is a pump in the garage,” so regardless of the logic of the conditional, the fact is stated explicitly in the context.

✅ Therefore, **yes, it is true that there is a pump in the garage.**"

- Q = “There is a pump in the garage”

We are told in the context:

- **There is no pump in the garage** → So Q is **false**.

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false** only when P is true and Q is false.  
That’s exactly the case here.

So Mary’s statement is **false**.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that there is a pump in the garage?**

Based on the context — **“there is no pump in the garage”** — the answer is clearly **no**.

Even if we only relied on Mary’s statement and the fact that the tire is flat, the falsity of her conditional implies that the conclusion (pump in garage) does not hold — which again supports that **there is no pump**.

B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, we cannot conclude that there is a pump in the garage based on what Mary says.

Mary says: **“If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.”**

This is a **conditional statement** (if P, then Q), where:

- P = “Your tire is flat”
- Q = “There is a pump in the garage”

You are told: **“Your tire is not flat.”** So P is **false**.

In logic, when the premise (P) of a conditional is false, the entire conditional statement (“If P, then Q”) is considered **true regardless of the truth value of Q**. But that does **not** tell us whether Q is actually true — it only tells us the implication holds.

So, Mary’s statement does **not** guarantee that there is a pump in the garage — it only guarantees that **if** the tire were flat, then there would be a pump. Since the tire is not flat, the statement doesn’t give us any information about whether the pump exists or not.

B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Mary says: *“If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.”*  
We are also told in the context: *“The plant is dry”* and *“there is a water can on the shelf.”*

So, Mary’s statement is a conditional:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The plant is dry” → **True** (given)  
- Q = “There is a water can on the shelf” → **True** (also given)

Since both the premise and the conclusion are true, the conditional statement holds, and the fact that there is a water can on the shelf is directly confirmed by the context — regardless of Mary’s statement.

Even if we only relied on Mary’s statement and the fact that the plant is dry, we could infer that there *should be* a water can on the shelf (assuming Mary is telling the truth). But since the context independently confirms it, we can say definitively:

✅ **Yes, there is a water can on the shelf.**"
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"".

Here’s why:

Mary says:  
> **“If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The plant is dry”  
- Q = “There is a water can on the shelf”

We are told:  
- The plant **is** dry → P is **true**  
- There is **no** water can on the shelf → Q is **false**

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false** only when P is true and Q is false.  
In all other cases, it’s true.

Based on the context:  
> “There is no water can on the shelf.”

So, **regardless of Mary’s statement**, the factual answer is:

B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is **not necessarily true** that there is a water can on the shelf.

### Reasoning:

Mary says:  
> **“If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The plant is dry”  
- Q = “There is a water can on the shelf”

We are told:  
> **The plant is not dry.**

So, **P is false**.

In logic, when the **antecedent (P) is false**, the conditional statement **“If P, then Q”** is **vacuously true**, regardless of the truth value of Q. That means Mary’s statement is still true — but it tells us **nothing about whether Q is true or false**.

In other words:  
- Mary only guarantees a water can **if** the plant is dry.  
- Since the plant is **not** dry, the condition doesn’t apply — so we **cannot conclude** whether there is a water can on the shelf or not.

### Final Answer:  
**We do not know. It may or may not be true.**  
So, **no, it is not necessarily true** that there is a water can on the shelf."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, based on what Mary says, **it is true that there is an iron in the closet** — *but only if we accept Mary’s statement as true and assume George’s shirt is wrinkled*.

Let’s break it down:

Mary says:  
> **“If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = George’s shirt is wrinkled  
- Q = There is an iron in the closet

We are also told in the context:  
> **George’s shirt is wrinkled** — so P is **true**.

In classical logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then **Q must be true** (this is called *Modus Ponens*).

Therefore, **if Mary’s statement is true**, and George’s shirt *is* wrinkled (which it is, per context), then **there is an iron in the closet**.

Additionally, the context *also independently confirms* that there is an iron in the closet — so even without relying on Mary’s statement, we know it’s true.

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” is **false** only when P is true and Q is false.  
That’s exactly the case here.

So, **Mary’s statement is false**.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that there is an iron in the closet?**

Based on the context — **“there is no iron in the closet”** — the answer is clearly **no**.

Mary’s statement is incorrect, but that doesn’t change the factual state of the world. The context tells us directly: **no iron in the closet**.

✅ Final Answer: **No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet.**"
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, we **cannot conclude** that there is an iron in the closet.

### Here's why:

Mary says:  
> **“If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = George’s shirt is wrinkled  
- Q = There is an iron in the closet

We are told:  
> **George’s shirt is not wrinkled.** → So **P is false**.

In logic, when the **antecedent (P) is false**, the conditional statement **“If P, then Q”** is **vacuously true**, regardless of whether Q is true or false.

That means:  
- Mary’s statement is **true** (since P is false, the implication holds).  
- But we **cannot infer anything about Q** (whether there is an iron in the closet).

### Example:
Think of it like:  
> “If it’s raining, I’ll bring an umbrella.”  
But it’s not raining.  
→ You don’t know whether I have an umbrella or not. Maybe I do, maybe I don’t.

### Conclusion:
Based on Mary’s statement and the fact that George’s shirt is **not** wrinkled, **we cannot determine** whether there is an iron in the closet.

✅ **Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that there is an iron in the closet.**"
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there are books on the shelf.

Mary states: *“If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf.”*  
This is a conditional statement — “If P, then Q” — where:  
- P = Susy wants to read  
- Q = There are books on the shelf

However, the context also tells us: *“Susy wants to read”* — so P is true.

In logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true (this is called *modus ponens*).

Therefore, since Mary’s statement is presented as true (we’re to take it at face value), and Susy does want to read, it follows that **there are books on the shelf**.

✅ Final Answer: **Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.**"
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is **not true** that there are books on the shelf.

Here’s why:

Mary says:  
> “If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf.”

This is a **conditional statement** — “If P, then Q”, where:  
- P = Susy wants to read  
- Q = There are books on the shelf

We are told in the context that **Susy wants to read** (P is true), and **there are no books on the shelf** (Q is false).

In logic, if P is true and Q is false, then the conditional “If P, then Q” is **false**.

So Mary’s statement is **false** — it does not match reality.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that there are books on the shelf?**

Based on the context — “there are no books on the shelf” — the answer is clearly **no**.

Mary’s statement is incorrect, but that doesn’t change the actual state of the world. The context explicitly says there are no books on the shelf.

✅ Final Answer: **No, it is not true that there are books on the shelf.**"
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf — **based on what Mary says**.

Mary’s statement:  
> “If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf.”

This is a conditional statement: *If P, then Q*, where:  
- P = Susy wants to read  
- Q = There are books on the shelf

In logic, a conditional statement “If P, then Q” does **not** require P to be true for Q to be true. It only says that **if** P is true, then Q must also be true. But Q can still be true even if P is false.

In this case, we are told that **Susy does not want to read** — so P is false. But Mary’s statement does **not** say that books are *only* on the shelf if Susy wants to read. She is simply stating that *if* Susy wants to read, then books are available (on the shelf). That implies the books are there regardless — otherwise, the conditional would be misleading or false.

Moreover, in natural language, when someone says “If you want to read, there are books on the shelf,” it’s typically understood as an assertion that the books *are* there — and the “if” is just offering them as an option.

Therefore, **based on what Mary says**, we can reasonably conclude:  
> **Yes, there are books on the shelf.**

✅ Final Answer: **Yes**"

The context states that “most people prefer green tea,” which implies that green tea is chosen or consumed more frequently by people, even though black coffee is cheaper. The fact that there is black coffee in the pot doesn’t contradict this — it may simply be available, but not necessarily preferred or used more.

Preference typically correlates with usage, especially when no other constraints (like availability or cost) override it. Since cost is not a barrier (black coffee is cheaper, yet still less preferred), the preference for green tea likely translates to higher usage.

Therefore, based on the context, green tea is more used than black coffee."

The context states: *“Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda.”* This implies that despite water’s health benefits, soda is still preferred by many — suggesting higher demand for soda.

Additionally, the fact that *“there is water in the freezer”* doesn’t indicate high demand; it may simply mean water is available or stored, perhaps even unused.

Therefore, based on the context, soda appears to be more in demand than water."

The context states that “people eat burgers more often” than sushi, even though sushi is healthier. This directly indicates that burgers have greater popularity in terms of consumption frequency. Additionally, the presence of sushi on the table doesn’t contradict this — it just shows sushi is available, not that it’s consumed more. Popularity here is measured by how often people choose to eat them, and burgers are chosen more frequently.

The statement “Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them” implies that despite their liveliness (which could be seen as a drawback by some), people still prefer dogs — suggesting dogs are more popular. The mention of a cat in the tree is irrelevant to the popularity comparison."
F7F,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are cats more popular than dogs?","No, cats are not more popular than dogs in this context.

The context states: “Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them.” The phrase “people prefer them” refers to dogs — meaning, despite (or perhaps because of) their liveliness, people prefer dogs over cats. This implies dogs are more popular.

Additionally, the sentence “There is a cat up in the tree” is descriptive and doesn’t affect the popularity comparison.

Therefore, based on the context, dogs are more popular than cats."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on Mary’s statement — **“If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza”** — and the fact that **the parrot is in the cage**, we can apply **modus ponens** (a valid rule of inference):

> If P, then Q.  
> P is true.  
> Therefore, Q is true.

Here:  
- P = “The parrot is in the cage” → **True** (given).  
- Q = “Thomas will bring pizza” → **Therefore, true**.

✅ **Answer: Yes, it is true that Thomas brought pizza.**

*(Note: This assumes Mary’s statement is a reliable conditional — i.e., she meant it as a logical implication — and that “will bring” refers to an action that has occurred or is guaranteed to occur given the condition.)*"
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Here’s the reasoning:

Mary said:

This is a conditional statement:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The parrot is in the cage” → **True** (given in context)  
- Q = “Thomas will bring pizza” → **We are to evaluate this**

In logic, if “If P then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q **must** be true for the statement to hold.

But we are also told:  
> **Thomas did not bring pizza.** → So Q is **false**.

This creates a **contradiction** with Mary’s statement — if her statement is true, then Thomas *must* have brought pizza (since the parrot *is* in the cage). But he didn’t.

Therefore, **Mary’s statement must be false**, or at least, **not satisfied** in this scenario.

But the question is:  
> **Is it true that Thomas brought pizza?**

Based on the direct statement:  
> **“Thomas did not bring pizza.”**

That is given as fact.

So regardless of Mary’s conditional, the factual answer is:

✅ Final Answer: **No**"
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that Thomas brought pizza.

Let’s break it down:

Mary said:  
> **“If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.”**

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The parrot is in the cage”  
- Q = “Thomas will bring pizza”

We are told:  
> **The parrot is not in the cage.**

So, **P is false**.

In logic, when the **antecedent (P) is false**, the conditional statement **“If P, then Q”** is considered **true regardless of Q** — this is called **vacuous truth**.

But here’s the key:  
**The truth of the conditional does not tell us whether Q (Thomas brought pizza) is true or false.**  
It only tells us that **if** the parrot were in the cage, then Thomas would bring pizza.  
Since the parrot is **not** in the cage, the condition was never triggered — so we have **no information** about whether Thomas brought pizza or not.

Therefore, based on Mary’s statement and the given context, **we cannot conclude that Thomas brought pizza**.

✅ Final Answer: **No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza — or at least, we cannot determine that from the given information.**"
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Not necessarily.

This is a conditional statement:

- Q = Mark will give you a candy

You *did* finish your broccoli (P is true), but that doesn’t *guarantee* Q is true — unless the statement is meant to be a promise or guarantee, which isn’t explicitly stated.

In logic, **“If P, then Q”** does not mean Q *must* happen just because P happened — unless it’s a biconditional (“if and only if”) or a binding promise. Also, Mary is reporting what *Mark will do*, not guaranteeing it.

Moreover, you also finished your pasta — but that’s irrelevant to Mary’s statement, which only mentions broccoli.

So, based *only* on what Mary says, we **cannot conclude for sure** that Mark gave you a candy — even though you finished your broccoli.

✅ **Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy.**"
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy.

Here’s why:

This is a conditional statement:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = You finish your broccoli  
- Q = Mark will give you a candy

You *did* finish your broccoli (P is true).  
But Mary did *not* give you a candy — and more importantly, **there’s no indication that Mark gave you a candy**.

However, note: Mary’s statement is about **Mark** giving you a candy — not herself. So even though she didn’t give you one (which is irrelevant to her promise), the key is whether **Mark** gave you one.

Since the context says **Mary did not give you a candy**, and says **nothing about Mark giving you one**, we must conclude that **Mark did not give you a candy** — otherwise, it would have been mentioned or implied.

Therefore, **the condition was met (you finished broccoli), but the consequence (Mark gives candy) did not occur** — meaning Mary’s statement was **false**, or at least, **not fulfilled**.

✅ So, **yes, it is true that Susan got a camera**, based on Mary’s statement and the given context.

**No, we cannot conclude that Susan got a camera.**  
It’s possible, but not guaranteed, based on the information given."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"".

This is a **conditional statement**:  
**If P, then Q**  
Where:  
- P = “The foxes are dancing”  
- Q = “Susan will get a camera”

We are told:  
> **“The foxes are not dancing.”**

That means **P is false**.

In logic, when the **antecedent (P) is false**, the conditional statement **“If P, then Q”** is considered **true regardless of Q** — but it tells us **nothing about the truth of Q**.

In other words:  
- Mary’s statement doesn’t say anything about what happens if the foxes are *not* dancing.  
- So Susan *might* still get a camera for other reasons — or she might not.  
- But based *only* on Mary’s statement and the fact that foxes are not dancing, **we cannot conclude that Susan got a camera**.

✅ Final Answer: **No, it is not necessarily true that Susan got a camera.**  
(We have no evidence that she did, and Mary’s statement doesn’t require it when the foxes aren’t dancing.)"

Mary said: **“If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.”**  
This is a conditional statement: **If P, then Q**, where  
- P = “The TV is on”  
- Q = “Matthew will bake cookies”

We are told that **the TV is on** — so the *antecedent* (P) is true.

In logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q *must* be true — **but only if the conditional statement itself is true**.

However, we are not told whether Mary’s statement is *actually true* — we are only told that *Mary said it*. People can say things that are false or hypothetical.

So, unless we assume Mary’s statement is a reliable truth (e.g., a promise or a known fact), we cannot conclude that Matthew baked cookies.

Additionally, even if we assume Mary’s statement is true, we still need to know whether the TV being on is the *only* condition for Matthew baking cookies — but that’s not specified.

**Conclusion**: Based *only* on what Mary says and the fact that the TV is on, we **cannot definitively conclude** that Matthew baked cookies — unless we assume Mary’s statement is a guaranteed truth.

We are told:  
- The TV **is** on.  
- Matthew **did not** bake cookies.

This directly **contradicts** Mary’s statement. In logic, if “If P, then Q” is true, and P is true, then Q must also be true. But here, P (TV is on) is true, and Q (Matthew bakes cookies) is false — so the conditional statement is **false**.

> **The TV is off.**

In logic, if the **antecedent (P)** is false, the conditional statement **“If P, then Q”** is considered **true regardless of Q** — but it tells us **nothing about whether Q is true or false**.

In plain terms:  
Mary only promised cookies **if the TV is on**.  
Since the TV is **off**, her statement doesn’t require Matthew to bake cookies — and it doesn’t say anything about what happens when the TV is off.

So:  
→ We **cannot conclude** that Matthew baked cookies.  
→ In fact, since the condition for baking cookies wasn’t met, it’s **more likely** he did **not** bake them — but we don’t have explicit information about his actions.

**Final Answer: No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies — or at least, we have no basis to say he did.**"
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on Mary’s statement — “If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple” — and the fact that today the weather **is sunny**, we can logically conclude that **Emma will wear purple**, assuming Mary’s statement is true and holds as a conditional rule.

This is a classic **modus ponens** logical structure:

- If P, then Q.  
- P is true.  
- Therefore, Q is true.

Where:  
- P = “The weather is sunny” → True (given)  
- Q = “Emma will wear purple” → Therefore, true (by Mary’s statement)

Mary said: **“If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.”**  
This is a conditional statement:  
> If P (weather is sunny), then Q (Emma wears purple).

We are told:  
- The weather **is** sunny → P is true.  
- Emma is wearing **green** → Q is false.

In logic, if P is true and Q is false, then the conditional “If P, then Q” is **false**.

So, Mary’s statement is **false** in this case — because the condition (sunny weather) is met, but the result (Emma wearing purple) did not happen.

Therefore, **Emma did not wear purple** — she wore green.

✅ Final Answer: **No, Emma did not wear purple.**"
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"".

Where:  
- P = “The weather is sunny”  
- Q = “Emma will wear purple”

But today, the weather is **rainy and windy** — **not sunny**.  
That means the **antecedent (P) is false**.

In logic, when the “if” part of a conditional is false, the whole conditional statement does **not** tell us anything about the truth of the “then” part. The statement “If P, then Q” is still considered **true** when P is false — but it doesn’t let us conclude whether Q is true or false.

So:  
→ We **cannot infer** whether Emma wore purple or not.  
→ The statement gives us **no information** about what Emma does when it’s **not sunny**.

Therefore, **based on Mary’s statement alone**, we **cannot say** that Emma wore purple — and since the weather is not sunny, it’s even less likely (though not logically impossible) that she did.

Here:  
- P = “The playground is empty” → **True** (given).  
- Q = “Angela will take a selfie” → **Therefore, true** (by Mary’s conditional).

That means **P is false** (playground is *not* empty).

We are told: **The lawn has been mowed.**  
But we are **not told who mowed it**. It could have been Paul, or someone else (e.g., Mary, a neighbor, a gardener).

Since we don’t know whether **Paul** was the one who mowed the lawn, we cannot conclude that the condition (P) was satisfied. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Paul got 50 euros.

Since the lawn has **not** been mowed, the condition (P) is **false**.

En el context donat, es diu que **“la gent els compra més”** (referint-se als plàtans), tot i que són més cars que els kiwis. Això indica que els plàtans tenen més demanda o són més populars entre els consumidors.

El text diu: *“Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent els prefereix.”*

Això implicaria que la gent prefereix els gats, malgrat que els gossos siguin més alegres.

Això és una **condicional**:

En lògica, una condicional **""Si P, llavors Q""** només és falsa quan P és verdader i Q és fals.  
Si P és fals, la condicional **és veritat independentment del valor de Q**.

Per tant, la frase de la Maria **és veritat** (perquè la condició no es compleix), **però això no ens diu res sobre si el Tomàs ha portat pizza o no**.

És a dir:  
- La condicional no s’ha activat (perquè el lloro no és a la gàbia).  
- Per tant, **no podem concloure que el Tomàs hagi portat pizza**.  
- De fet, **no hi ha cap informació que ens digui que ho hagi fet**.

A més, el fet que el gos no sigui a la gossera no té relació amb la condicional de la Maria.

### Conclusió:
**No, no és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza** — o almenys, **no ho podem afirmar** basant-nos en el que diu la Maria i el context donat.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre?","No, **no és veritat** que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre.

### Explicació:

La Maria va dir:  
> **""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre.""**

Això és una **condicional**:  
**Si P, llavors Q**, on:  
- P = El gos està jugant → **veritat** (segons el context)  
- Q = L'Antoni llegirà un llibre → **fals** (segons el context: *L'Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre*)

En lògica, una condicional **""Si P, llavors Q""** només és **falsa** quan P és cert i Q és fals.  
En aquest cas, **P és cert i Q és fals**, per tant, **la condicional és falsa**.

Però la pregunta no és si la condicional és veritat, sinó:  
> **És veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre?**

I el context diu clarament:  
> **L'Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre.**

Per tant, **la resposta és NO**, no és veritat que l'Antoni hagi llegit un llibre.

S8C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El gos no està jugant. A més, el gat està dormint. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre?","No, no és veritat que l'Antoni hagi llegit un llibre.

**Raó:**  
La Maria va dir:

Això és una condicional:  
**Si P, llavors Q**

- P = “El gos està jugant”  
- Q = “L’Antoni llegirà un llibre”

Però el context ens diu:  
> *“El gos no està jugant.”*

En lògica, quan la condició (P) és falsa, la condicional **“Si P, llavors Q”** és **veritable independentment del valor de Q**. Però això **no ens permet concloure res sobre Q** (si l’Antoni ha llegit o no).

És a dir, la frase de la Maria **no ens obliga** a concloure que l’Antoni hagi llegit un llibre, perquè la condició no s’ha complert. Potser l’Antoni ha llegit, potser no — **no ho sabem**.

Però la pregunta és:  
> *És veritat que l’Antoni ha llegit un llibre?*

Com que **no tenim cap informació que ens digui que l’Antoni hagi llegit**, i la condicional no s’ha activat (perquè el gos no està jugant), **no podem afirmar que sigui veritat**.

Per tant, la resposta correcta és:  
> **No, no és veritat que l’Antoni hagi llegit un llibre** — perquè no hi ha cap evidència que ho confirmi, i la condicional no s’ha aplicat.

Questa è una **proposizione condizionale** (se A, allora B), dove:

Questa è una **proposizione condizionale** (se A, allora B), dove:

In logica, una condizionale “Se A, allora B” è **vera** in tutti i casi **tranne quando A è vera e B è falsa**.

Cioè: anche se non c’è pizza in forno, la frase di Maria rimane vera.

Quindi:  
- Maria non afferma che c’è pizza in forno.

In logica, quando l’antecedente di un’implicazione è falso (P falso), **l’implicazione “Se P, allora Q” è comunque vera**, indipendentemente dal valore di Q. Ma questo **non ci dice nulla sulla verità di Q**.

In altre parole:

- A = la pianta è secca

Una pianta **rigogliosa** implica che **non è secca** — anzi, è sana, ben idratata, probabilmente ben curata.

In logica, quando l’antecedente di un’implicazione è falso, **l’implicazione è comunque vera**, ma **non possiamo dedurre nulla sul conseguente** (B).

Ma poiché la condizione per cui l’annaffiatoio *dovrebbe* esserci (pianta secca) **non si verifica**, e non ci sono altre informazioni che confermino la sua presenza, **non possiamo affermare che sia vero**.

In altre parole:  
- Maria non ha detto che *solo se* la camicia è stropicciata c’è il ferro nell’armadio.

Inoltre, il fatto che ci siano banane nel cesto della frutta (e non viene menzionato che ci siano kiwi) rinforza l’idea che le banane siano scelte più frequentemente.

La popolarità, in questo caso, si misura dal comportamento d’acquisto: se la gente compra più banane nonostante il prezzo più alto, è ragionevole concludere che siano più popolari."
F6F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante le banane siano più costose dei kiwi, la gente le acquista di più. Ci sono banane nel cesto della frutta. In questo contesto, i kiwi sono più popolari delle banane?","No, i kiwi non sono più popolari delle banane.

Nel contesto fornito si afferma che **nonostante le banane siano più costose dei kiwi, la gente le acquista di più**. Questo indica che le banane hanno una domanda maggiore, e quindi sono più popolari rispetto ai kiwi. La popolarità, in questo caso, si misura dal comportamento d’acquisto: se la gente compra più banane, significa che preferisce o apprezza di più le banane, anche a prezzo più alto.

Inoltre, il fatto che **ci siano banane nel cesto della frutta** (e non si menzionano kiwi) potrebbe ulteriormente suggerire una preferenza o una maggiore presenza delle banane nella scelta quotidiana.

Quindi, la risposta corretta è: **No, i kiwi non sono più popolari delle banane.**"

La frase dice: *“Nonostante i cani siano più vivaci dei gatti, le persone li preferiscono”*.  
La parola **“li”** si riferisce ai **gatti**, perché è l’unico sostantivo al plurale precedente (i cani → “loro”, i gatti → “li”). Quindi, la frase significa:

Quindi, **P è falso** (il parco non è vuoto).

In logica, quando l’antecedente di una condizionale è falso, **la condizionale è considerata vera indipendentemente dal conseguente** — ma **non possiamo dedurre nulla sul conseguente**.

**Spiegazione:**

Questa è una **condizionale**: “Se A, allora B”.  
- A = Paolo taglia il prato  
- B = Paolo riceve 50 euro

Sappiamo che **il prato è stato tagliato**, ma **non sappiamo chi lo ha tagliato**. Potrebbe essere stato Paolo, ma anche qualcun altro (Maria, un giardiniere, un vicino...).

Poiché non abbiamo conferma che **Paolo** sia stato il tagliatore, **non possiamo concludere che abbia ricevuto i 50 euro**.

In logica, da “Se A, allora B” e “B è vero” (o “A è vero”?) non si può dedurre necessariamente che “B è vero” se non sappiamo che A è stato effettivamente verificato da Paolo.

In questo caso, sappiamo che il prato è stato tagliato (quindi “A” è vero *in generale*), ma non sappiamo se **Paolo** è stato l’agente. Quindi **non possiamo dedurre che B (ricevere 50 euro) sia avvenuto**.

Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No, no se puede afirmar que haya un paraguas en el paragüero.

María dice: **“Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero”**.  
Esto es una afirmación condicional: **Si P, entonces Q**.  
Donde:  
- P = “El tiempo está lluvioso”  
- Q = “Hay un paraguas en el paragüero”

Pero en el contexto se dice que **el tiempo está despejado**, es decir, **P es falso**.

En lógica, cuando la premisa de una implicación es falsa (P es falso), la implicación **“Si P, entonces Q”** es **verdadera independientemente del valor de Q**.  
Esto significa que la afirmación de María sigue siendo verdadera, pero **no nos permite concluir nada sobre Q** (es decir, si hay o no paraguas en el paragüero).

Además, el hecho de que haya un **chubasquero en el coche** no implica nada directamente sobre la presencia de un paraguas en el paragüero.

**Conclusión:**  
No, no es verdad que haya un paraguas en el paragüero —o al menos, **no podemos afirmarlo con base en la información dada**. La afirmación de María no se aplica porque la condición (tiempo lluvioso) no se cumple.

✅ **Respuesta final: No, no se puede afirmar que haya un paraguas en el paragüero.**"
B6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. También hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Sí, según lo que dice María, **es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje**.

María afirma:  
> *""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.""*

Y en el contexto se nos dice que **la rueda del coche está pinchada**.  
Entonces, la condición del “si” se cumple, y por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, **la conclusión debe ser verdadera**: hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.

Esto es un razonamiento condicional válido:  
**Si P, entonces Q.**  
**P es verdadero.**  
→ Por lo tanto, **Q es verdadero.**

Esto es una afirmación condicional:  
**Si P, entonces Q**  
donde:  
- P = ""La rueda del coche está pinchada"" → **verdadero** (según el contexto)  
- Q = ""Hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"" → **falso** (según el contexto: *no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje*)

Entonces, tenemos:  
**P es verdadero, Q es falso → la implicación ""Si P, entonces Q"" es falsa.**

Pero la pregunta no es si la afirmación de María es verdadera, sino:  
> **¿Es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?**

María dice: **“Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje”**.  
Esto es una **condicional**: *Si P, entonces Q*.

Pero en el contexto se dice que **la rueda del coche está inflada**, lo que implica que **no está pinchada**.  
Entonces, la condición (P) es **falsa**.

En lógica, cuando la premisa de una condicional es falsa, la condicional **no nos permite concluir nada sobre la verdad de la conclusión**. Es decir, **Q puede ser verdadera o falsa** — no lo sabemos con la información dada.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos afirmar que haya una bomba de aire en el garaje** solo basándonos en lo que dice María y en el hecho de que la rueda está inflada.

B7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y hay un regador en la estantería. También hay una manguera en el jardín.

María afirma:

Y en el contexto se dice que **la planta está seca**.  
Entonces, la condición del “si” se cumple, y por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, **la conclusión debe ser verdadera**: hay un regador en la estantería.

Esto es un razonamiento condicional válido:  
**Si P, entonces Q.**  
**P es verdadero.**

María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","No, **no es verdad** que haya un regador en la estantería.

### Explicación:

María dice:  
> **""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería.""**

Esto es una afirmación condicional:  
**Si P, entonces Q**  
donde:  
- P = ""La planta está seca""  
- Q = ""Hay un regador en la estantería""

Pero en el contexto se nos dice que:  
- **La planta está seca** → P es **verdadero**  
- **No hay ningún regador en la estantería** → Q es **falso**

Entonces, la afirmación de María (**Si P, entonces Q**) es **falsa**, porque cuando el antecedente (P) es verdadero y el consecuente (Q) es falso, la implicación es falsa.

Además, como el contexto **afirma directamente** que no hay regador en la estantería, **independientemente de lo que diga María**, la respuesta a la pregunta “¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?” es **no**.

B7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta no está seca. Hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","No, no es verdad que haya un regador en la estantería.

**Explicación:**

María dice:  
> **""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería.""**

Esto es una afirmación condicional:  
**Si P, entonces Q**  
donde:  
- P = ""la planta está seca""  
- Q = ""hay un regador en la estantería""

Pero el contexto nos dice:  
> **""La planta no está seca.""**

Es decir, **P es falso**.

En lógica, cuando en una implicación **""Si P, entonces Q""** la premisa P es falsa, la implicación **no nos permite concluir nada sobre Q**. Es decir, Q puede ser verdadero o falso; la implicación sigue siendo válida en ambos casos.

Sin embargo, **la pregunta es: ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?**

Y **no tenemos ninguna información directa** sobre si el regador está o no en la estantería. Solo sabemos que **la planta no está seca**, por lo tanto, **la condición que activaría la presencia del regador no se cumple**.

Pero eso **no implica que el regador no esté allí** — podría estar, o no. No lo sabemos.

Sin embargo, en el contexto de este tipo de preguntas lógicas, **si la condición no se cumple, no podemos afirmar que la consecuencia sea verdadera**. Y como no hay otra información que confirme la presencia del regador, **la respuesta más correcta es que no podemos afirmar que sea verdad**.

Pero la pregunta es directa: **¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?**

Y como **no hay evidencia de que lo haya**, y la única afirmación que lo vincula (la condicional de María) no se activa (porque la planta no está seca), **la respuesta lógica es: no, no es verdad** — o al menos, **no podemos decir que sea verdad**.

En muchos contextos de lógica y razonamiento, si no se puede demostrar que algo es verdadero, y la única condición que lo haría verdadero no se cumple, se considera que **no es verdad** (en el sentido de ""no está confirmado como verdadero"").

Además, si hubiera un regador en la estantería, María no lo mencionaría solo condicionalmente — pero eso es especulación.

**Conclusión final:**

> **No, no es verdad que haya un regador en la estantería**, porque la condición que lo implicaría (planta seca) no se cumple, y no hay otra información que lo confirme.

María afirma:

Y en el contexto se nos dice que **la camisa de Jorge está arrugada**.  
Entonces, la condición del “si... entonces...” se cumple (el antecedente es verdadero), y por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, **la conclusión también debe ser verdadera**: hay una plancha en el armario.

Aunque en la realidad también se menciona que hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón, eso no afecta la verdad de la afirmación de María, que solo se refiere a la existencia de una plancha en el armario —y eso es lo que se está preguntando.

Esto es una **afirmación condicional**:

- Q = Hay una plancha en el armario → **Falso** (según el contexto: *no hay ninguna plancha en el armario*).

En lógica, una implicación **""Si P, entonces Q""** es **falsa solo cuando P es verdadero y Q es falso**.  
En este caso, **P es verdadero y Q es falso**, por lo tanto, **la afirmación de María es falsa**.

Pero la pregunta no es si María dice la verdad, sino:

- Q = ""Hay una plancha en el armario""

Esto implica que **la camisa NO está arrugada**, es decir, **P es falso**.

En lógica, cuando en una condicional **el antecedente (P) es falso**, la condicional **es verdadera independientemente del valor de Q**. Pero eso **no nos permite concluir nada sobre Q**.

Es decir:  
- María no afirma que haya una plancha en el armario.  
- Solo dice que **si** la camisa estuviera arrugada, **entonces** habría una plancha en el armario.  
- Como la camisa **no está arrugada**, la condición no se activa, y **no podemos deducir si hay o no plancha en el armario**.

Además, el hecho de que haya una tabla de planchar en el balcón **no implica** que haya una plancha en el armario —podría estar en otro lugar, o no existir.

### Conclusión:
**No podemos afirmar que haya una plancha en el armario.**  
Por lo tanto, **no es verdad** (al menos, no se puede afirmar como verdadero con la información dada).

Además, la afirmación de María es **falsa**, porque la condición (Susana quiere leer) se cumple, pero el resultado (hay libros en la estantería) **no se cumple**. En lógica, si “si A, entonces B” y A es verdadero pero B es falso, la afirmación completa es falsa.

**Justificación:**  
El contexto indica que *“la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde”*, lo que implica un mayor consumo o uso del té verde en comparación con el café negro, a pesar de que este último sea más barato. Además, aunque haya café negro en la cafetera, eso no contradice la preferencia general de la gente. La preferencia mayoritaria suele traducirse en mayor uso o consumo.

S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, **no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza**.

Según el contexto:

- El loro **está en la jaula** (condición cumplida).
- María dijo: *«Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza»*.  
  Esto es una afirmación condicional: **Si P, entonces Q**.
  - P = El loro está en la jaula → **verdadero**.
  - Q = Tomás trae pizza → **falso** (según el contexto: *Tomás no trajo pizza*).

Entonces, la afirmación de María **no se cumplió**. En lógica, si P es verdadero y Q es falso, la implicación “Si P, entonces Q” es **falsa**.

Pero la pregunta no es si la afirmación de María es verdadera, sino: **¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?**

Y la respuesta directa, según el contexto, es: **No, Tomás no trajo pizza**.

✅ **Respuesta final: No, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.**"
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, **no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza**.

### Explicación:

María dijo:  
> **«Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza»**.

Esto es una **condicional**:  
> **Si P, entonces Q**  
Donde:  
- P = El loro está en la jaula  
- Q = Tomás trae pizza

Pero en el contexto se nos dice:  
> **El loro no está en la jaula** → es decir, **P es falso**.

En lógica, cuando la premisa de una condicional es falsa (P es falso), **la condicional es verdadera independientemente del valor de Q**. Pero eso **no nos permite concluir que Q sea verdadero**.

Es decir:  
- Si el loro **estuviera** en la jaula → Tomás traería pizza.  
- Pero como el loro **no está** en la jaula, **no podemos afirmar nada sobre si Tomás trajo pizza o no**... **a menos que tengamos más información**.

Sin embargo, la pregunta es:  
> **¿Es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?**

Y la respuesta debe basarse **solo en lo que dijo María y en el contexto dado**.

Como la condición para que Tomás traiga pizza (el loro en la jaula) **no se cumplió**, **no hay razón para afirmar que Tomás trajo pizza**. De hecho, **la afirmación de María no se activa**, por lo tanto, **no podemos concluir que Tomás haya traído pizza**.

Además, en contextos de lógica y razonamiento, si no hay evidencia de que la consecuencia se haya cumplido, y la condición no se cumplió, **la respuesta más correcta es que no, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza** — porque no hay base para afirmarlo.

✅ **Respuesta final: No, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.**"
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no se puede afirmar con certeza que Marcos te dio un caramelo.

María dijo: **“Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo”**. Esto es una condicional: **si A, entonces B**.

Tú te comiste el brócoli (A es verdadero), pero **la condicional solo garantiza B si A es verdadero y la promesa se cumple**. Sin embargo, **no sabemos si Marcos cumplió su parte**. María solo dijo lo que *pasaría si* te comías el brócoli, pero no confirmó que Marcos efectivamente te dio el caramelo.

Además, aunque te comiste la pasta, eso no afecta la condición de María, que solo mencionó el brócoli.

**Conclusión**: Según lo que dijo María, **no se puede concluir que Marcos te dio un caramelo**, porque la promesa no se ha verificado como cumplida. Solo se cumplió la condición (comerte el brócoli), pero no se confirma el resultado (recibir el caramelo).

✅ **Respuesta final: No, no se puede afirmar que Marcos te dio un caramelo, según lo que dijo María.**"

Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo.

Según lo que dijo María: **“Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo”**.  
Tú te comiste el brócoli (la condición se cumplió), pero **Marcos no te dio un caramelo** (el resultado no se cumplió).

Por lo tanto, **la afirmación de María resultó falsa** en este caso, porque la condición se cumplió pero la consecuencia no.

✅ Respuesta final: **No, Marcos no te dio un caramelo.**"
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo.

Según lo que dijo María: **“Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo”**.  
Esto es una condición: solo si comes el brócoli, entonces Marcos te da un caramelo.

Pero en el contexto se dice: **“No te has comido el brócoli”**.  
Como la condición no se cumplió, **no se activa la consecuencia** (es decir, Marcos no te da el caramelo).

Según lo que dijo María:  
**“Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara.”**

En el contexto se dice que **los zorros están bailando**, por lo tanto, según la condición de María, **Irene recibirá una cámara**.

No hay ninguna mención de **Susana** en la afirmación de María, ni en el contexto. Por lo tanto, **no se puede concluir que Susana recibiera una cámara**, y de hecho, la afirmación se refiere explícitamente a **Irene**.

✅ Respuesta final: **No, es falso que Susana recibió una cámara.**"
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?","No, **no es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara**.

Según el contexto:

- **Los zorros están bailando** → esto activa la condición de la afirmación de María.
- María dijo: *“Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara”* → por lo tanto, **Susana** recibirá una cámara (si asumimos que la afirmación de María es verdadera).
- Además, se dice explícitamente: **“Irene no recibió una cámara”**.

Entonces, **Irene no recibió una cámara**, y eso es directamente afirmado en el contexto. La afirmación de María solo implica algo sobre **Susana**, no sobre Irene.

✅ **Respuesta final: No, Irene no recibió una cámara.**"
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No, no se puede concluir que **Susana recibió una cámara**.

Analicemos el contexto:

- **Los zorros no están bailando.**
- **Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo.**
- **María dijo:** *“Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara.”*

Esto es una afirmación condicional:  
**Si P, entonces Q**  
Donde:  
- P = “Los zorros están bailando” → **Falso** (según el contexto)  
- Q = “Irene recibirá una cámara”

En lógica, cuando el antecedente (P) es falso, la implicación **“Si P, entonces Q”** es **verdadera independientemente del valor de Q**. Es decir, la afirmación de María sigue siendo válida, pero **no nos dice nada sobre si Irene recibió o no la cámara**, porque la condición nunca se cumplió.

Además, **la pregunta es sobre Susana**, no sobre Irene.  
María no mencionó a Susana en absoluto. No hay ninguna información que conecte a Susana con la cámara.

### Conclusión:
**No, no es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara —de hecho, no hay base alguna para afirmarlo.**

María dijo: **“Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas”**. Esto es una afirmación condicional: *Si P, entonces Q*, donde:

- P = La televisión está encendida.
- Q = Mateo hará galletas.

Sabemos que **P es verdadero** (la televisión está encendida), pero **eso no garantiza que Q sea verdadero** a menos que la condicional sea verdadera *y* se cumpla el antecedente. Sin embargo, **una condicional no implica que el consecuente ocurra solo porque el antecedente es verdadero**, a menos que se asuma que la condicional es verdadera en todos los casos (lo cual no se especifica).

Además, **no se nos dice que la afirmación de María sea verdadera** — solo que *ella dijo* eso. Podría estar equivocada, o podría ser una suposición, o incluso una broma.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos concluir con certeza que Mateo hizo galletas** solo con la información dada.

Según el contexto:

- La televisión **está encendida**.

- Pero **Mateo no hizo galletas**.

Esto significa que la afirmación de María **no se cumplió**. En lógica, si tenemos una implicación “Si P, entonces Q” (P → Q), y P es verdadero pero Q es falso, entonces la implicación es **falsa**.

En este caso:
- P: “La televisión está encendida” → **verdadero**.
- Q: “Mateo hará galletas” → **falso** (porque no las hizo).

En lógica, cuando el antecedente (P) de una condicional es falso, la condicional **no nos permite concluir nada sobre el consecuente (Q)**. Es decir, **Mateo podría o no haber hecho galletas** — la afirmación de María no lo obliga a hacerlas si la TV está apagada.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos afirmar que Mateo hizo galletas** basándonos solo en lo que dijo María y en el hecho de que la TV está apagada.

**Razón:**  
María dijo: *“Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado”*.  
Hoy, el tiempo **está soleado** (según el contexto), por lo tanto, se cumple la condición del “si”, y según la afirmación de María, **Emma va a ir de morado**.

Aunque no se menciona directamente que Emma *efectivamente* fue de morado, la afirmación de María es una condicional que se cumple en este caso, y como no hay información que contradiga su afirmación, **se puede concluir que, según lo que decía María, es verdad que Emma fue de morado**.

Sabemos que **el perro está jugando** (A es verdadero), por lo tanto, **según la afirmación de María, Antonio leerá un libro** (B debería ser verdadero).

Pero aquí hay un matiz importante: **la afirmación de María es una promesa o una regla que ella estableció**, no un hecho comprobado. Es decir, **si creemos en lo que dijo María**, entonces sí, Antonio leyó un libro.

Sin embargo, **si solo nos basamos en hechos observables**, no tenemos evidencia directa de que Antonio haya leído un libro —solo sabemos que el perro está jugando y que María dijo que *si eso pasa, entonces Antonio leerá*.

Entonces, la respuesta depende del enfoque:

- **Desde la lógica de la afirmación de María**: Sí, Antonio leyó un libro (porque la condición se cumplió).
- **Desde la evidencia observable**: No podemos afirmarlo con certeza, porque no se menciona que Antonio haya leído.

Además, el hecho de que el horno esté estropeado no afecta directamente la promesa de María sobre los donuts.

**Conclusión:** Según lo que decía María, **no podemos afirmar que Ana trajo donuts**, porque aunque se cumplió la condición (nevera vacía), no sabemos si se cumplió la consecuencia (Ana trajo donuts). Podría haberlo hecho… o no.
