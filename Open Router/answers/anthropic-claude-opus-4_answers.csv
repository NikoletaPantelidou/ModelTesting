B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

From the context, we already know that ""there is pizza in the oven"" is a fact. Mary's statement ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"" is consistent with this fact. Since we also know that John is hungry (from the context), Mary's conditional statement would lead to the same conclusion - that there is pizza in the oven.

However, the truth about the pizza being in the oven doesn't depend on Mary's statement or whether John is hungry. It's simply stated as a fact in the given context."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Looking at this logically:

Given facts:
- John is hungry (true)
- There is no pizza in the oven (true)
- Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If P (John is hungry), then Q (there is pizza in the oven)""

Since we know:
- P is true (John IS hungry)
- Q is false (there is NO pizza in the oven)

This means Mary's conditional statement is false (a true antecedent with a false consequent makes the whole conditional false).

To answer your question: **No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven.**

The context explicitly states there is no pizza in the oven. Mary's statement is simply incorrect - she's making a false claim about the situation."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Looking at this logical problem, I need to analyze Mary's conditional statement: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""

This is an ""if-then"" statement where:
- Antecedent (condition): John is hungry
- Consequent (result): There is pizza in the oven

Given facts:
- John is NOT hungry (the antecedent is false)
- Mary makes the conditional statement above

In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire conditional statement is considered true regardless of whether the consequent is true or false. This means Mary's statement is true whether or not there's actually pizza in the oven.

Since John is not hungry, Mary's conditional statement tells us nothing definitive about whether there's pizza in the oven. The pizza could be there or not - both possibilities are consistent with Mary's statement being true.

Therefore, based solely on what Mary says and the given facts, **we cannot determine whether there is pizza in the oven**. The answer is: we don't know."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Based on what Mary says, we cannot determine whether there is aspirin on the table.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""

From the context, we know that:
- Nicole's head hurts (condition is true)
- There is aspirin on the table (this is stated as fact in the context)

However, the question asks what we can conclude based solely on what Mary says. Mary's conditional statement alone doesn't tell us whether there actually is aspirin on the table - it only tells us that IF Nicole's head hurts, THEN there is aspirin on the table.

To determine from Mary's statement alone whether there is aspirin on the table, we would need to know whether Nicole's head hurts. Since the question asks us to base our answer only on what Mary says (not on the other contextual information), we cannot definitively conclude that there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Looking at this logical puzzle:

Given facts:
- Nicole's head hurts (TRUE)
- There is no aspirin on the table (FALSE)
- There is no ibuprofen in the drawer (irrelevant to the question)

Mary's statement: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table""

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) that claims:
- IF Nicole's head hurts → THEN there is aspirin on the table

Since we know Nicole's head DOES hurt, and we know there is NO aspirin on the table, Mary's statement is demonstrably false.

However, the question asks: ""Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?""

If we were to believe Mary's statement and we know Nicole's head hurts, then according to Mary's logic, there should be aspirin on the table.

But in reality, there is no aspirin on the table.

**Answer: No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table.** The actual facts contradict what Mary's statement would imply."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Looking at this logical problem:

Given information:
- Nicole's head does not hurt
- There is ibuprofen in the drawer (this is irrelevant to the logical analysis)
- Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table""

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. In logic, when the condition (antecedent) of an if-then statement is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.

Since Nicole's head does NOT hurt, the condition ""Nicole's head hurts"" is false. This means:
- Mary's statement is true (because a conditional with a false antecedent is always true)
- We cannot determine from Mary's statement alone whether there actually is aspirin on the table

**Answer: We cannot determine whether there is aspirin on the table based on what Mary says.**

Mary's statement only tells us what would be the case IF Nicole's head hurt. Since Nicole's head doesn't hurt, Mary's statement doesn't give us any information about whether aspirin is actually on the table or not."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is water in the fridge.

Here's the logical reasoning:

1. Mary states: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge""
2. We know from the context that Lucy IS thirsty
3. Since Lucy is thirsty (the condition is met), then according to Mary's statement, there must be water in the fridge

This aligns with what we already know from the context (that there is indeed water in the fridge), but based solely on Mary's conditional statement and the fact that Lucy is thirsty, we can conclude that there is water in the fridge."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","Based on what Mary says and the given context, let me analyze this step by step.

Given facts:
- Lucy is thirsty
- There is no water in the fridge
- There is no apple juice on the shelf
- Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""

Since we know that Lucy IS thirsty, and Mary's statement claims that if Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge, then according to Mary's statement, there should be water in the fridge.

However, we also know from the context that there is actually no water in the fridge.

So to answer your question: According to what Mary says, it would be true that there is water in the fridge (because Lucy is thirsty and Mary's conditional statement would lead to that conclusion).

But in reality, Mary's statement is false because we know there is no water in the fridge despite Lucy being thirsty."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on Mary's statement ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge,"" we cannot determine whether there is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It only tells us what would be true IF Lucy were thirsty. Since Lucy is NOT thirsty (as stated in the context), the condition of Mary's statement is not met.

When the condition of an ""if-then"" statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about whether the consequence is true or false. The water could be in the fridge or it might not be - Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about this situation.

So the answer is: **We cannot determine whether there is water in the fridge based on Mary's statement.**"
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Looking at this logical reasoning problem:

Given facts:
- Peter's phone is dead (true)
- There is a charger in the drawer (true)
- There is a computer on the table
- Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer""

Mary's statement is a conditional: If P (phone is dead), then Q (charger in drawer).

Since we know from the context that:
1. Peter's phone IS dead (P is true)
2. There IS a charger in the drawer (Q is true)

Based on what Mary says AND the given facts, **yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer**.

This is true both because:
- The context directly states there is a charger in the drawer
- Mary's conditional statement, combined with the fact that Peter's phone is dead, logically implies there should be a charger in the drawer"
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Let me analyze this step by step.

Given facts:
1. Peter's phone is dead
2. There is no charger in the drawer
3. There is no computer on the table (this seems irrelevant to the question)

Mary's statement:
""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer""

This is a conditional statement in the form ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = Peter's phone is dead
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer

According to Mary's statement, since Peter's phone IS dead (P is true), then there SHOULD be a charger in the drawer (Q should be true).

However, we know from the given facts that there is NO charger in the drawer.

So based on what Mary says, it would be true that there is a charger in the drawer. But this contradicts the actual fact that there is no charger in the drawer.

**Answer: According to Mary's statement, yes, there should be a charger in the drawer. However, this conflicts with the given fact that there is no charger in the drawer, which means Mary's statement is false.**"
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on Mary's statement and the given context, we cannot determine whether there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer""

This is a conditional statement (if-then). Since we know Peter's phone is fully charged (not dead), the condition ""Peter's phone is dead"" is false. 

When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the ""then"" part is true or false. The charger could be in the drawer, or it might not be - Mary's statement simply doesn't give us this information when Peter's phone is charged.

So the answer is: **We cannot determine whether there is a charger in the drawer based on the given information.**"
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Here's why:

1. Mary states: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""
2. The context tells us that the weather IS rainy
3. Since the condition (rainy weather) is met, according to Mary's statement, there must be an umbrella on the coat rack

Additionally, the context directly confirms this by stating ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack,"" which aligns with what Mary's conditional statement would predict given the rainy weather."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on what Mary says and the given context, I need to analyze this logically.

Given facts:
- The weather is rainy
- There is no umbrella on the coat rack
- Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If rainy → umbrella on coat rack""

Since the weather IS rainy (the condition is met), according to Mary's statement, there should be an umbrella on the coat rack.

However, we know from the context that there is actually NO umbrella on the coat rack.

So to answer the question: **No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.**

This means Mary's statement is false - her conditional claim doesn't match reality. The weather is rainy but there is no umbrella on the coat rack, which contradicts what she says should be the case."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on Mary's statement and the given context, I cannot determine whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Here's why:

Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""

This is a conditional statement (if-then). The current weather is sunny, not rainy. When the condition ""if the weather is rainy"" is false (as it is here), the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about whether or not there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

The umbrella could be there or not - Mary's statement simply doesn't apply to the current sunny weather situation."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is a pump in the garage.

Mary states: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.""

From the context, we know that your tire IS flat. Since the condition ""your tire is flat"" is true, and Mary's statement says that when this condition is met, ""there is a pump in the garage,"" then according to Mary's statement, there must be a pump in the garage.

Note that the context also independently confirms there is a pump in the garage, which aligns with what Mary's conditional statement would conclude given the flat tire."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Looking at this logically:

Given facts:
- Your tire is flat (True)
- There is no pump in the garage (False for ""pump in garage"")

Mary's statement: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage""

This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q) where:
- P = ""your tire is flat"" (True)
- Q = ""there is a pump in the garage"" (False)

Since we know:
1. The tire IS flat (P is true)
2. There is NO pump in the garage (Q is false)

This means Mary's conditional statement is false, because when the condition (flat tire) is met, the conclusion (pump in garage) doesn't follow.

To answer the question: **No, it is not true that there is a pump in the garage.**

The context explicitly states ""there is no pump in the garage,"" which directly contradicts what Mary's statement would require to be true."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"".

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.""

Since we know your tire is NOT flat, the condition (antecedent) of her statement is false. When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about whether the ""then"" part is true or false.

B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on what Mary says and the given context, I can analyze this logical statement:

Mary's statement: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf""
- This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q)
- P = ""the plant is dry""
- Q = ""there is a water can on the shelf""

From the context, we know:
- The plant IS dry (P is true)
- There IS a water can on the shelf (Q is true)

Since we're asked to evaluate based on what Mary says:
- Mary's conditional statement is: If P, then Q
- We know P is true (the plant is dry)
- According to Mary's logic, when P is true, Q must be true

Therefore, based on what Mary says, **yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf**.

Note: This conclusion aligns with the actual facts given in the context, but even if we didn't know the actual state of the water can, Mary's statement combined with the fact that the plant is dry would lead us to conclude that there must be a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Let me analyze this step by step.

Given facts:
- The plant is dry
- There is no water can on the shelf

Mary's statement:
- ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf""

This is a conditional statement in the form ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = ""the plant is dry"" 
- Q = ""there is a water can on the shelf""

Since we know that:
1. The plant IS dry (P is true)
2. According to Mary's statement, when P is true, Q must be true
3. Therefore, according to Mary's statement, there should be a water can on the shelf

However, the actual facts tell us there is NO water can on the shelf.

So the answer is: **No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.**

Mary's statement is actually false because we have a case where the plant is dry (the condition is met) but there is no water can on the shelf (the conclusion doesn't follow). The reality contradicts what Mary claims."

Given facts:
- The plant is not dry
- There is a hose in the garden
- Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf""

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. In logic, when we have ""If P, then Q"" and P is false, we cannot determine whether Q is true or false.

Since the plant is not dry (the ""if"" condition is false), Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether there is a water can on the shelf or not.

The water can could be on the shelf for other reasons, or it might not be there at all. We simply cannot determine this from the given information.

Answer: **We cannot determine whether there is a water can on the shelf based on the given information.**"
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot determine whether there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""

We know from the context that:
- George's shirt IS wrinkled (the condition is true)
- There IS an iron in the closet (this is given as a fact)

However, the question asks what we can conclude based solely on what Mary says. Mary's conditional statement alone doesn't tell us whether there actually is an iron in the closet. It only tells us that IF the shirt is wrinkled, THEN there is an iron in the closet.

To properly use Mary's conditional statement, we would need to:
1. Know that George's shirt is wrinkled (which we do)
2. Apply the conditional rule to conclude there is an iron in the closet

But since the question asks what we can determine from Mary's statement alone, without using the other contextual information, we cannot definitively say whether there is an iron in the closet based solely on her conditional statement."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either.

Therefore, the answer is: **No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet.**

Mary's statement is simply incorrect - it contradicts the actual facts provided in the context."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Looking at this logical statement, I need to analyze what Mary said: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""

This is a conditional statement of the form ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = George's shirt is wrinkled

From the context, we know that George's shirt is NOT wrinkled (P is false).

When the condition (P) of an ""If P, then Q"" statement is false, the entire conditional statement is automatically true regardless of whether Q is true or false. This means Mary's statement tells us nothing about whether there actually is an iron in the closet.

To illustrate:
- If there IS an iron in the closet: Mary's statement is true (false → true = true)
- If there is NO iron in the closet: Mary's statement is still true (false → false = true)

Therefore, based solely on what Mary says and the given context, we cannot determine whether there is an iron in the closet or not.

The answer is: **We cannot determine if it's true or false that there is an iron in the closet.**"
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there are books on the shelf.

Mary's statement ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"" directly asserts that there are books on the shelf. The conditional ""if"" part only relates to why Mary might be mentioning the books (because Susy wants to read), but the second part of her statement clearly confirms that books are present on the shelf.

This is also consistent with the context provided, which independently states that ""there are books on the shelf."""
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"".

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) claim. Since we know that Susy DOES want to read, Mary's statement would logically imply that there are books on the shelf.

However, we also know from the given facts that there are NO books on the shelf.

This means Mary's statement is **false** - she is either mistaken or lying about the situation.

**Answer: No, it is not true that there are books on the shelf.**

The actual facts tell us there are no books on the shelf, regardless of what Mary claims."

The books could be on the shelf or they might not be - Mary's statement simply doesn't give us this information when Susy doesn't want to read."
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Based on the given context, yes, pizza appears to be more popular than pasta.

The context states that ""people buy it more"" (referring to pizza), even though pizza is more expensive than pasta. The fact that people choose to buy more pizza despite its higher price suggests it is more popular - people are willing to pay more for it and purchase it more frequently than pasta."
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?","Based on the context provided, no, pasta is not more popular than pizza.

The context explicitly states that ""people buy it [pizza] more"" even though pizza is more expensive than pasta. The fact that people choose to buy more pizza despite its higher price indicates that pizza is more popular than pasta."
F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","Based on the context provided, I cannot definitively answer whether green tea is more used than black coffee.

The context tells us that ""most people prefer green tea"" over black coffee, but preference doesn't necessarily equal usage. People might prefer one thing but use another more frequently due to various factors like availability, cost, or convenience.

For example:
- Since black coffee is cheaper (as stated), people might use it more despite preferring green tea
- The fact that ""there is black coffee in the pot"" might suggest black coffee is being used at that moment
- People might prefer green tea but drink black coffee more often at work or in certain situations

Without specific data about actual consumption or usage patterns, I can only confirm that green tea is more preferred, not necessarily more used."

In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","Based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer whether black coffee is more used than green tea.

The context tells us that:
- Most people prefer green tea
- Black coffee is cheaper than green tea
- There is black coffee in the pot (indicating at least some usage)

However, preference doesn't necessarily equal usage. People might prefer green tea but still use black coffee more frequently due to factors like:
- Lower cost (as mentioned)
- Availability
- Convenience
- Different uses (e.g., morning routine vs. afternoon beverage)

The fact that there's black coffee in the pot suggests it is being used, but this single observation doesn't provide enough information to compare overall usage rates between black coffee and green tea."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Based on the context provided, yes, soda appears to be more in demand than water. The context explicitly states that ""many choose soda"" despite water being healthier. This indicates that people are selecting soda over water, suggesting higher demand for soda.

The fact that there is water in the freezer (presumably available) while people still choose soda further supports this conclusion - even with water readily available, people are opting for soda instead."

F5F,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, is sushi more popular than burgers?","Based on the context provided, no, sushi is not more popular than burgers. 

The context explicitly states that ""people eat burgers more often"" than sushi. The frequency of consumption is a key indicator of popularity, and since burgers are eaten more often, they would be considered more popular than sushi.

The fact that sushi is healthier or that there is sushi on the table doesn't change the relative popularity between the two foods."

The context tells us that despite bananas being more expensive than kiwis, people still purchase bananas more frequently. This suggests that bananas are more popular, as consumers are willing to pay a higher price for them and buy them more often than the cheaper kiwis.

The fact that there are bananas in the basket (but no mention of kiwis) could also support this conclusion, though this detail alone wouldn't be definitive evidence of popularity."
F6F,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are kiwis more popular than bananas?","Based on the context provided, **no, kiwis are not more popular than bananas**.

The context explicitly states that ""people purchase them [bananas] more"" despite bananas being more expensive than kiwis. The fact that people buy more bananas even though they cost more suggests that bananas are more popular than kiwis. Additionally, the mention of bananas being in the basket (with no mention of kiwis) further supports that bananas are the more popular choice."

In this context, are dogs more popular than cats?","Based on the context provided, yes, dogs appear to be more popular than cats. The text explicitly states that ""people prefer them"" when referring to dogs, despite acknowledging that dogs are more lively than cats. This preference indicates that dogs are more popular.

The mention of ""a cat up in the tree"" doesn't provide information about popularity - it's just an observation about a cat's location."
F7F,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are cats more popular than dogs?","Based on the context provided, **cats are not more popular than dogs**.

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Looking at this logically:

Given facts:
- The parrot is in the cage
- Mary said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza""

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. Since we know the condition ""the parrot is in the cage"" is true, and Mary stated that this condition implies ""Thomas will bring pizza,"" then according to Mary's statement, Thomas will bring pizza.

However, I need to be careful here. The question asks if it's true that Thomas **brought** pizza (past tense), while Mary's statement says Thomas **will bring** pizza (future tense). 

Based solely on the information provided:
- We can conclude that according to Mary's statement, Thomas will bring pizza
- But we cannot definitively confirm whether Thomas has already brought pizza

So the answer is: **We cannot determine with certainty whether Thomas has already brought pizza based on the given information.** We only know that according to Mary's conditional statement, Thomas will bring pizza at some point."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Looking at this logical problem, I need to analyze what we know and what Mary said.

Given facts:
- The parrot is in the cage
- The dog is in the doghouse  
- Thomas did not bring pizza
- Mary said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza""

Mary's statement is a conditional: If P (parrot is in the cage), then Q (Thomas will bring pizza).

We know that:
- P is true (the parrot IS in the cage)
- Q is false (Thomas did NOT bring pizza)

According to Mary's conditional statement, since the parrot is in the cage, Thomas should bring pizza. However, we know factually that Thomas did not bring pizza.

Therefore, **No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza.** We are explicitly told that ""Thomas did not bring pizza.""

Note: This also means Mary's conditional statement turned out to be false, since the condition was met (parrot in cage) but the consequence didn't follow (no pizza from Thomas)."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Looking at this logically:

Mary said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza""

This is a conditional statement in the form ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = ""the parrot is in the cage""
- Q = ""Thomas will bring pizza""

From the context, we know that ""The parrot is not in the cage"" (P is false).

When the condition (P) of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement itself is considered true regardless of whether the conclusion (Q) happens or not. This means Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether Thomas brought pizza when the parrot is NOT in the cage.

Therefore, based solely on what Mary said and the given context, **we cannot determine whether Thomas brought pizza or not**. The answer is: **We don't know**."

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on what Mary said, I cannot determine whether Mark actually gave you a candy.

Mary stated a conditional: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""

You did finish your broccoli, which means the condition was met. However, Mary's statement only tells us what Mark *will* do according to her - it doesn't confirm whether Mark actually followed through and gave you the candy.

So the answer is: **We cannot know for certain** whether Mark gave you a candy based solely on Mary's statement and the fact that you finished your broccoli."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"".

Mary's statement was: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy""

The facts are:
- I finished my broccoli
- I finished my pasta
- Mary did not give me a candy

According to Mary's conditional statement:
- The condition (finishing broccoli) was met ✓
- Therefore, the consequence (Mark will give you a candy) should follow

Based on Mary's statement and the fact that I finished my broccoli, **yes, it is true that Mark gave me a candy**.

Note: The information about Mary not giving me a candy is separate from what Mary said about Mark giving candy. Mary's statement was specifically about Mark's action, not her own."

Mary's statement was: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""

Since you didn't finish your broccoli, the condition for getting candy was not met. However, this doesn't tell us whether Mark gave you candy anyway. Mary only told us what would happen IF you finished your broccoli - she didn't say anything about what would happen if you didn't finish it.

So the answer is: **We cannot determine from the given information whether Mark gave you a candy or not.**"
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Looking at the given information:

1. The foxes are dancing (stated as fact)
2. Mary said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera""

Since Mary made a conditional statement (if-then), and the condition ""the foxes are dancing"" is true according to the context, then according to Mary's statement, Susan will get a camera.

However, there's an important distinction: Mary's statement tells us what *will* happen according to her, not necessarily what *has already* happened. The question asks if Susan ""got"" a camera (past tense), but based on Mary's statement, we only know that Susan ""will get"" a camera (future tense).

So strictly speaking: Based solely on what Mary says and the given context, we cannot definitively confirm that Susan has already gotten a camera. We only know that according to Mary's conditional statement, Susan will get one since the foxes are dancing."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Looking at the given information:

1. The foxes are dancing (given)

Since Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then statement), and we know that:
- The condition ""the foxes are dancing"" is TRUE
- According to Mary's statement, when this condition is true, then ""Susan will get a camera""

Therefore, based on what Mary says, **yes, it is true that Susan got a camera**.

The if-then logic works like this: Since the foxes ARE dancing, and Mary said that IF the foxes are dancing THEN Susan will get a camera, we can conclude that Susan got a camera."

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It only tells us what happens IF the foxes are dancing. Since the foxes are NOT dancing, the condition is not met.

When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, we cannot determine anything about the ""then"" part. The statement doesn't tell us what happens when the foxes are not dancing.

Therefore, based solely on what Mary said and the given information, we cannot determine whether Susan got a camera or not. The answer is: **We don't know**."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on what Mary said, we cannot determine for certain whether Matthew baked cookies.

Mary's statement was: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies""

Given information:
- The TV is on
- The radio is also on (this is irrelevant to Mary's conditional statement)

Since the TV is on, and according to Mary's conditional statement Matthew will bake cookies if the TV is on, then based solely on Mary's statement, Matthew should bake cookies.

However, it's important to note that:
1. Mary's statement is about what Matthew ""will"" do, not necessarily what he ""did"" do
2. We only know what Mary said would happen - we don't have direct information about whether Matthew actually baked cookies
3. People don't always do what others predict they will do

So the most accurate answer is: According to Mary's conditional statement, Matthew should have baked cookies (since the TV is on), but we cannot verify with certainty that he actually did bake them based solely on the given information."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Looking at this step by step:

Given facts:
- The TV is on
- The radio is on
- Matthew did not bake cookies
- Mary said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies""

Mary's statement can be written as: TV on → Matthew bakes cookies

Since we know the TV is on AND we know Matthew did not bake cookies, this means Mary's statement turned out to be false.

To answer the question: **No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.**

We are explicitly told that ""Matthew did not bake cookies,"" so regardless of what Mary predicted, the fact is that Matthew did not bake cookies."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Looking at this step by step:

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It tells us what happens when the TV is on, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens when the TV is off.

Since the TV is off, the condition ""the TV is on"" is false. When the condition of an if-then statement is false, we cannot determine whether the conclusion (Matthew baking cookies) is true or false based on that statement alone.

Matthew might have baked cookies for other reasons, or he might not have baked cookies at all. Mary's statement simply doesn't give us enough information to know.

Here's why:

1. We know the weather is sunny today
2. Mary said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple""

However, Mary's statement tells us what Emma WILL wear if it's sunny, but:
- We don't know if Mary's prediction is accurate or reliable
- We don't have any actual information about what Emma wore
- Mary could be wrong about Emma's clothing choices

So while we can say that according to Mary's statement, Emma should wear purple on sunny days, and today is sunny, we cannot confirm whether Emma actually wore purple without direct information about what Emma wore today.

- Emma is wearing green
- Mary said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple""

According to Mary's statement, sunny weather should lead to Emma wearing purple. Since the weather IS sunny today, Mary's statement predicts that Emma should be wearing purple.

However, Emma is actually wearing green, not purple.

Therefore, **no, it is not true that Emma wore purple**. Emma wore green, which means Mary's prediction/statement was incorrect."

Based on the given facts, Angela did NOT take a selfie.

Therefore, the answer is: **No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.**

Note: This means Mary's conditional statement turned out to be false in this case, since the playground was empty but Angela didn't take a selfie as Mary predicted."

Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It only tells us what happens when the playground IS empty. Since the playground is actually crowded (not empty), the condition in Mary's statement is not met.

When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, we cannot determine whether the ""then"" part happened or not. The statement simply doesn't apply to this situation.

We know:

2. Someone else mowed the lawn - In this case, Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether Paul gets money

Without knowing who mowed the lawn, we cannot determine if Paul got 50 euros based solely on Mary's statement."

Given facts:

In logic, when the condition (P) of an ""if-then"" statement is false, we cannot determine whether the conclusion (Q) is true or false based solely on that conditional statement. The conditional only tells us what happens when P is true.

Therefore: **We cannot determine whether Paul got 50 euros or not based solely on the given information.**

The answer is: No, we cannot conclude that it's true that Paul got 50 euros. We simply don't have enough information to know whether he received the money or not."

So based on what Mary said, Amy should have brought donuts since the fridge is empty. However, the actual fact is that Amy did not bring donuts.

Therefore, the answer is: **No, it is not true that Amy brought donuts.**

Mary's prediction/statement turned out to be incorrect - even though the condition (empty fridge) was met, the predicted outcome (Amy bringing donuts) did not occur."
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Let me work through this step-by-step.

Given information:
- The fridge is full
- The oven is on (this seems irrelevant to the question)
- Mary said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If [fridge is empty], then [Amy will bring donuts]""

The condition (fridge is empty) is FALSE because we're told the fridge is full.

When the ""if"" part of an ""if-then"" statement is false, we cannot conclude anything about whether the ""then"" part happened or not. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen IF the fridge were empty, but since it's not empty, we have no information about whether Amy brought donuts.

Amy might have brought donuts for other reasons, or she might not have brought them at all. Mary's statement doesn't help us determine this.

**Answer: We cannot determine whether Amy brought donuts based on the given information.**"

La planxa podria estar a l'armari o no estar-hi - l'afirmació de la Maria no ens dona aquesta informació quan la camisa no està arrugada.

B9T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Susanna vol llegir i hi ha llibres a l'estanteria. També hi ha un diari al sofà. La Maria diu: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria?","Segons el que diu la Maria, **no es pot afirmar amb certesa que hi hagi llibres a l'estanteria**.

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"". Aquesta és una implicació lògica (Si P, aleshores Q).

Del context sabem que:
- La Susanna vol llegir (P és cert)
- Hi ha llibres a l'estanteria (Q és cert segons el context)

Però la pregunta demana què podem deduir **només** del que diu la Maria. Com que la Maria fa una afirmació condicional i sabem que la condició (la Susanna vol llegir) és certa, aleshores segons la lògica de la seva afirmació, **SÍ que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria**.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria."
B9F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Susanna vol llegir i no hi ha llibres a l'estanteria. Tampoc no hi ha cap diari al sofà. La Maria diu: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria?","Analitzem la situació:

**Fet 1:** La Susanna vol llegir  
**Fet 2:** No hi ha llibres a l'estanteria  
**Fet 3:** La Maria diu: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria""

La Maria està fent una afirmació condicional (Si P, aleshores Q):
- P: La Susanna vol llegir
- Q: Hi ha llibres a l'estanteria

Segons el context, sabem que P és cert (la Susanna vol llegir) i Q és fals (no hi ha llibres a l'estanteria).

Per tant, **segons el que diu la Maria**, si la Susanna vol llegir (que és cert), aleshores haurien d'haver-hi llibres a l'estanteria.

Però la realitat contradiu l'afirmació de la Maria, ja que NO hi ha llibres a l'estanteria.

**Resposta:** No, no és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria. L'afirmació de la Maria és falsa perquè la realitat (no hi ha llibres) contradiu el que ella afirma."
B9C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Susanna no vol llegir. Hi ha un diari al sofà. La Maria diu: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha llibres a l'estanteria?","Analitzant la situació:

1. **Fet conegut**: La Susanna NO vol llegir
2. **Afirmació de la Maria**: ""Si la Susanna vol llegir, hi ha llibres a l'estanteria""

Aquesta és una afirmació condicional del tipus ""Si P, aleshores Q"", on:
- P = ""La Susanna vol llegir"" 
- Q = ""Hi ha llibres a l'estanteria""

Com que sabem que P és **fals** (la Susanna NO vol llegir), la condició de l'afirmació no es compleix. En lògica, quan l'antecedent (P) d'una afirmació condicional és fals, l'afirmació sencera és tècnicament certa, però **no ens diu res sobre si Q és cert o fals**.

Per tant, **no podem determinar** si hi ha llibres a l'estanteria o no basant-nos només en el que diu la Maria, ja que la seva afirmació només ens informaria sobre els llibres en el cas que la Susanna volgués llegir.

**Resposta**: No es pot saber només amb aquesta informació."

Aquesta conclusió es basa en la informació que, malgrat que la pizza és més cara que la pasta, la gent la compra més. Normalment, quan un producte és més car però es ven més, això indica que és més popular o preferit pels consumidors. La gent està disposada a pagar més per la pizza, la qual cosa suggereix que la prefereixen per sobre de la pasta."

El text indica clarament que ""la gent compra més"" pizza, tot i que és més cara que la pasta. Això demostra que la pizza és més popular, ja que les persones prefereixen comprar-la malgrat el seu preu més elevat."
F2T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que el cafè és més barat que el te verd, la majoria de la gent prefereix el te verd. Hi ha cafè a la cafetera. En aquest context, el te s'utilitza més que el cafè?","Basant-me en el context proporcionat, **sí, el te s'utilitza més que el cafè**.

El context indica clarament que ""la majoria de la gent prefereix el te verd"" malgrat que el cafè sigui més barat. Quan la majoria de persones prefereixen el te verd, és raonable deduir que també l'utilitzen més que el cafè."
F2F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que el cafè és més barat que el te verd, la majoria de la gent prefereix el te verd. Hi ha cafè a la cafetera. En aquest context, el cafè s'utilitza més que el te?","Basant-me en el context proporcionat, **no**, el cafè no s'utilitza més que el te.

El context indica clarament que ""la majoria de la gent prefereix el te verd"", tot i que el cafè és més barat. Això suggereix que el te verd es consumeix o s'utilitza més que el cafè, ja que té la preferència de la majoria de persones.

El fet que hi hagi cafè a la cafetera només indica que algú utilitza cafè, però no contradiu la informació que la majoria prefereix (i per tant, probablement utilitza més) el te verd."

El text indica explícitament que ""molta gent tria les begudes gasoses"" tot i que l'aigua és més saludable. Això suggereix que hi ha una preferència o demanda més alta per les begudes gasoses en comparació amb l'aigua, almenys entre el grup de persones al qual es refereix el context.

El fet que es mencioni que ""hi ha aigua al congelador"" podria indicar que l'aigua està disponible però no s'està consumint tant com les begudes gasoses."

El text indica clarament que ""la gent els utilitza més"" referint-se als bròquils, tot i que són més difícils de cuinar que els nyoquis.

En aquest context, les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi?","Sí, segons el context, les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi.

El text indica clarament que ""la gent menja més sovint les hamburgueses"" tot i que el sushi sigui més saludable. Això suggereix que les hamburgueses tenen més popularitat o preferència entre la gent, ja que es consumeixen amb més freqüència."
F5F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que el sushi és més saludable que les hamburgueses, la gent menja més sovint les hamburgueses. Hi ha sushi a la taula. En aquest context, el sushi és més popular que les hamburgueses?","No, el sushi no és més popular que les hamburgueses.

Segons el context, encara que el sushi sigui més saludable, la gent menja hamburgueses més sovint. Això indica que les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi, ja que la popularitat es pot mesurar per la freqüència de consum."
F6T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els plàtans són més cars que els kiwis, la gent els compra més. Hi ha platans al cabàs. En aquest context, els platans són més populars que els kiwis?","Basant-me en el context proporcionat, **sí, els plàtans són més populars que els kiwis**.

Això es pot deduir perquè:
1. Tot i ser més cars que els kiwis, la gent compra més plàtans
2. El fet que la gent estigui disposada a pagar més per un producte i comprar-lo en major quantitat indica que és més popular
3. A més, es menciona que hi ha plàtans al cabàs, la qual cosa reforça que efectivament es compren

Per tant, la popularitat dels plàtans supera la dels kiwis, malgrat tenir un preu superior."
F6F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els plàtans són més cars que els kiwis, la gent els compra més. Hi ha platans al cabàs. En aquest context, els kiwis són més populars que els plàtans?","Basant-me en el context proporcionat, la resposta és **NO**.

El context indica clarament que ""la gent compra més plàtans"" tot i que són més cars que els kiwis. Això suggereix que els plàtans són més populars que els kiwis, no a l'inrevés.

Si els kiwis fossin més populars, la gent els compraria més, però el text estableix el contrari."
F7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent els prefereix. Hi ha un gat pujat a l'arbre. En aquest context, els gossos són més populars que els gats?","Analitzant el context proporcionat:

El text diu: ""Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent els prefereix.""

Aquesta frase és ambigua perquè el pronom ""els"" podria referir-se a:
- Els gossos (si seguim la proximitat gramatical)
- Els gats (si interpretem el ""tot i que"" com una concessiva que introdueix un contrast)

La construcció ""Tot i que X, Y"" normalment indica un contrast o contradicció. Per tant, la interpretació més lògica seria: ""Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent prefereix els gats.""

**Resposta: No, segons el context, els gats són més populars que els gossos**, ja que la gent els prefereix malgrat que els gossos siguin més alegres."

El text diu clarament: ""Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, **la gent els prefereix**."" 

El ""els"" en aquesta frase es refereix als gats (ja que són l'últim substantiu mencionat abans del pronom), indicant que malgrat que els gossos siguin més alegres, la gent prefereix els gats.

Per tant, segons aquest context, els gats són més populars."

S5F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Avui el temps és assolellat. Tampoc no fa vent. L'Emma va de verd. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el temps és assolellat, l'Emma anirà de morat"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Emma va de morat?","Analitzem la situació pas a pas:

- Segons la Maria: Si fa sol → Emma va de morat
- Realitat: Fa sol, però l'Emma va de verd (no de morat)

**Resposta:**
No, no és veritat que l'Emma va de morat. De fet, l'Emma va de verd, tal com s'indica al context. La predicció de la Maria era incorrecta."
S5C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Avui el temps és plujós. A més, també fa molt de vent. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el temps és assolellat, l'Emma anirà de morat"".

La Maria havia dit: ""Si el temps és assolellat, l'Emma anirà de morat"". Però sabem que avui el temps NO és assolellat (és plujós i fa vent).

Quan la condició d'una afirmació condicional (""Si A, llavors B"") no es compleix, no podem deduir res sobre el conseqüent. La Maria només ens diu què passaria SI el temps fos assolellat, però no ens diu res sobre què fa l'Emma quan el temps NO és assolellat.

Per tant, basant-nos només en la informació que tenim, no sabem si l'Emma va de morat o no."

2. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el parc infantil està buit, l'Alba es farà una selfie""
3. Com que es compleix la condició (el parc està buit), segons el que diu la Maria, l'Alba es farà una selfie

**Resposta: Sí, segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Alba s'ha fet una selfie**, perquè el parc infantil està buit i aquesta era la condició que havia establert la Maria."
S6F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El parc infantil està buit. Els carrers també estan tranquils. L'Alba no s'ha fet cap selfie.

3. **Afirmació de la Maria**: ""Si el parc infantil està buit, l'Alba es farà una selfie""

Segons la Maria, si el parc està buit → l'Alba es fa una selfie.

Però sabem que:
- El parc SÍ que està buit
- L'Alba NO s'ha fet cap selfie

Això contradiu el que havia dit la Maria.

**Resposta**: No, NO és veritat que l'Alba s'ha fet una selfie. De fet, el context ens diu explícitament que ""L'Alba no s'ha fet cap selfie"", la qual cosa demostra que la predicció de la Maria era incorrecta."
S6C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El parc infantil està ple de gent. Els carrers també estan animats. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el parc infantil està buit, l'Alba es farà una selfie"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Alba s'ha fet una selfie? ","Analitzant la informació:

1. El parc infantil està ple de gent (no està buit)
2. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el parc infantil està buit, l'Alba es farà una selfie""
3. Com que el parc infantil NO està buit (està ple), la condició de la Maria no es compleix

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, **NO podem afirmar que l'Alba s'hagi fet una selfie**. La Maria només garantia que l'Alba es faria una selfie si el parc estava buit, però com que està ple, no tenim informació sobre si l'Alba s'ha fet una selfie o no."
S7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","Analitzant la informació proporcionada:

**Fet conegut:** La gespa ha estat tallada.

**Condició de la Maria:** ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros""

**El que NO sabem:** Qui ha tallat la gespa.

La condició de la Maria només s'aplica si és el Pau qui ha tallat la gespa. Com que el context no especifica qui ha fet aquesta tasca, no podem afirmar que el Pau hagi rebut els 50 euros.

**Resposta: No es pot determinar si és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros**, perquè no tenim informació sobre qui ha tallat la gespa."
S7F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. El Pau no ha rebut 50 euros. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"".

2. El Pau NO ha rebut 50 euros (això és un fet confirmat)
3. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros""

La pregunta és si és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros.

La resposta és **NO**, no és veritat que el Pau hagi rebut 50 euros.

El context ens diu explícitament que ""El Pau no ha rebut 50 euros"", per tant, és fals afirmar que els ha rebut.

Nota: Tot i que la gespa ha estat tallada, no podem saber amb certesa si l'ha tallada el Pau o algú altre. El fet que no hagi rebut els 50 euros podria indicar que no va ser ell qui la va tallar, o bé que la Maria no ha complert la seva promesa."

1. **Fet conegut**: La gespa NO ha estat tallada

L'afirmació de la Maria és una condicional del tipus ""Si P, aleshores Q"":
- P = El Pau talla la gespa
- Q = El Pau rep 50 euros

Com que sabem que la gespa NO ha estat tallada, sabem que P és fals.

En lògica, quan tenim una condicional ""Si P, aleshores Q"" i P és fals, no podem deduir res sobre Q. La condicional només ens diu què passa SI el Pau talla la gespa, però no ens diu res sobre què passa si NO la talla.

Per tant, **no podem afirmar si és veritat o no que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros**. Podria haver-los rebut per alguna altra raó, o podria no haver-los rebut. La informació donada no és suficient per determinar-ho."

1. **Fet confirmat**: El gos està jugant
2. **Afirmació de la Maria**: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre""

Segons la lògica:
- La Maria ha establert una condició: SI el gos juga → ALESHORES l'Antoni llegirà
- Sabem que el gos SÍ que està jugant
- Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre

**Resposta**: Sí, segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Antoni llegirà un llibre (o està llegint un llibre), perquè es compleix la condició que ella ha establert.

*Nota: Cal tenir en compte que això només és cert si confiem en l'afirmació de la Maria. La realitat podria ser diferent si la Maria s'equivoca o no diu la veritat.*"

Sabem que P és **fals** (el gos NO està jugant).

En lògica, quan la condició (P) d'una afirmació condicional és falsa, l'afirmació condicional en si mateixa és verdadera independentment del que passi amb Q. Això significa que l'Antoni pot llegir o no llegir un llibre, i l'afirmació de la Maria continuaria sent certa.

**Resposta:** Sí, segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Anna ha portat donuts (o els portarà), ja que es compleix la condició que la nevera està buida.

Nota: La informació sobre el forn espatllat és irrellevant per a aquesta deducció."
S9F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La nevera està buida. A més, el forn està espatllat. L'Anna no ha portat donuts. La Maria havia dit: ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Anna ha portat donuts?","Analitzem la situació pas a pas:

Sabem que:
- P és cert (la nevera està buida)
- Q és fals (l'Anna NO ha portat donuts)

Segons la lògica, si la premissa (P) és certa però la conclusió (Q) és falsa, això significa que l'afirmació condicional de la Maria és **falsa**.

**Sì, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno.**

**Fatti dati:**
- Gianni ha fame

**Affermazione di Maria:**
- ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno""

Maria sta facendo un'affermazione condizionale (se... allora...). Secondo la sua affermazione, la fame di Gianni implica che ci sia pizza in forno.

Tuttavia, sappiamo già che:
1. Gianni ha fame (vero)
2. Non c'è pizza in forno (falso che ci sia)

Quindi l'affermazione di Maria è **falsa**, perché la condizione (Gianni ha fame) è vera, ma la conseguenza (c'è pizza in forno) è falsa.

Ecco il ragionamento:

1. Dal contesto sappiamo che: ""Nicoletta ha mal di testa e ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo""

**Risposta:** No, non è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. 

L'affermazione di Maria è falsa perché contraddice la realtà descritta nel contesto. Maria afferma che quando piove c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli, ma nei fatti il tempo è piovoso e l'ombrello non c'è."

Dati:
- Il tempo è sereno (non piovoso)
- C'è un impermeabile in macchina
- Maria afferma: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli""

L'affermazione di Maria è un'implicazione logica del tipo ""Se P allora Q"", dove:
- P = ""il tempo è piovoso""
- Q = ""c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli""

Dato che il tempo è sereno (quindi NON piovoso), la condizione P è falsa.

In logica, quando l'antecedente (P) di un'implicazione è falso, l'implicazione è sempre vera, indipendentemente dal valore di verità del conseguente (Q). Questo significa che l'affermazione di Maria non ci fornisce alcuna informazione su whether c'è o meno un ombrello nel portaombrelli quando il tempo non è piovoso.

**Risposta**: Non possiamo determinare se c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli basandoci solo sull'affermazione di Maria, perché la sua affermazione riguarda solo il caso in cui il tempo sia piovoso, mentre nella situazione attuale il tempo è sereno."

Maria aveva detto: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica""

Questa è un'implicazione logica della forma ""Se P, allora Q"", dove:
- P = ""le volpi stanno ballando""
- Q = ""Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica""

- Le volpi NON stanno ballando (quindi P è falso)

In logica, quando la premessa (P) di un'implicazione è falsa, l'implicazione è sempre vera, indipendentemente dal valore di Q. Questo significa che non possiamo dedurre nulla su Q (se Susanna abbia ricevuto o meno la macchina fotografica).

Maria ha promesso qualcosa SOLO nel caso in cui le volpi stessero ballando. Dato che le volpi non stanno ballando, la condizione non si è verificata e Maria non è vincolata dalla sua affermazione.

La condizione di Maria stabilisce che Paolo riceve 50 euro SOLO SE è lui a tagliare il prato. Poiché il testo non specifica chi ha tagliato il prato, potrebbe essere stato:

- Qualcun altro
- Non è specificato

La promessa di Maria è una condizione del tipo ""Se A, allora B"":
- A = Paolo taglia il prato
- B = Paolo riceve 50 euro

Dal contesto sappiamo che Paolo NON ha ricevuto 50 euro (¬B).

In logica, quando abbiamo ""Se A, allora B"" e sappiamo che B è falso (¬B), possiamo dedurre che anche A deve essere falso (¬A). Questo si chiama ""modus tollens"".

B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Según lo que dice María, **sí, es verdad que hay agua en la nevera**.

María afirma: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Sabemos del contexto que Lucía efectivamente tiene sed. Por lo tanto, según la afirmación condicional de María, se cumple que hay agua en la nevera.

Es importante notar que esto es lo que se deduce de la afirmación de María. No sabemos si María está diciendo la verdad o no, pero según su lógica condicional y el hecho de que Lucía tiene sed, la conclusión es que hay agua en la nevera."
B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"".

María está haciendo una afirmación condicional: ""**Si** el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, **entonces** hay un cargador en el cajón"".

Del contexto sabemos que:
- El móvil de Pedro efectivamente se ha quedado sin batería (esto es un hecho)
- Hay un cargador en el cajón (esto también es un hecho del contexto)

Sin embargo, la pregunta es sobre lo que podemos concluir **según lo que dice María**. Como María solo está afirmando una relación condicional, y la condición se cumple (el móvil está sin batería), entonces según su afirmación sí podríamos concluir que hay un cargador en el cajón.

Por lo tanto, **según lo que dice María, sí es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón**, porque la condición que ella establece (móvil sin batería) se cumple."
B4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y no hay ningún cargador en el cajón. Tampoco hay un ordenador sobre la mesa.

María afirma: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"".

Dado que:
- El móvil de Pedro SÍ se ha quedado sin batería (según el contexto)
- María establece que SI esto ocurre, ENTONCES hay un cargador en el cajón

Por lo tanto, según la lógica de la afirmación de María, debería haber un cargador en el cajón.

Sin embargo, es importante notar que el contexto también nos dice que ""no hay ningún cargador en el cajón"", lo que significa que la afirmación de María es **falsa** en la realidad, pero según lo que ella dice, sí debería haber un cargador."
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"".

Dado que sabemos que el móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena (es decir, NO se ha quedado sin batería), la condición de la afirmación de María no se cumple. 

En lógica, cuando el antecedente de una condicional (la parte del ""si"") es falso, no podemos deducir nada sobre el consecuente (la parte del ""entonces""). María solo nos dice qué pasaría SI el móvil no tuviera batería, pero no nos dice nada sobre qué pasa cuando el móvil SÍ tiene batería.

Por lo tanto, basándonos únicamente en lo que dice María, no podemos determinar si hay o no hay un cargador en el cajón."
B5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y hay un paraguas en el paragüero. También hay un chubasquero en el coche.

La afirmación de María es **FALSA**.

María dice que cuando llueve, hay un paraguas en el paragüero. Pero el contexto nos dice claramente que:

María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero""

Esta es una afirmación condicional del tipo ""Si P, entonces Q"", donde:
- P = ""el tiempo está lluvioso""
- Q = ""hay un paraguas en el paragüero""

Según el contexto, sabemos que ""el tiempo está despejado"", lo que significa que NO está lluvioso.

En lógica, cuando tenemos una afirmación condicional ""Si P, entonces Q"" y sabemos que P es falso (no está lluvioso), no podemos determinar si Q es verdadero o falso. La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué ocurre cuando llueve, pero no nos dice nada sobre qué ocurre cuando no llueve.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos saber si hay un paraguas en el paragüero o no**, basándonos únicamente en lo que dice María y en la información proporcionada.

La respuesta es: **No se puede determinar** si es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero."

**Información dada:**
- La rueda del coche está inflada (NO pinchada)

- A = ""la rueda del coche está pinchada""
- B = ""hay una bomba de aire en el garaje""

Pero según el contexto, A es FALSO (la rueda está inflada, no pinchada).

**Respuesta:** No podemos saber si hay una bomba de aire en el garaje basándonos solo en lo que dice María, porque su afirmación solo nos indica qué habría en el caso de que la rueda estuviera pinchada, lo cual no ocurre."

S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","Para responder esta pregunta, necesito analizar la lógica del condicional que dijo María.

María dijo: ""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza""

Esto es una afirmación condicional de la forma ""Si P, entonces Q"", donde:
- P = ""el loro está en la jaula""
- Q = ""Tomás traerá pizza""

Según el contexto, sabemos que:
- El loro NO está en la jaula (P es falso)

En lógica proposicional, cuando el antecedente (P) de un condicional es falso, el condicional completo es verdadero independientemente del valor de verdad del consecuente (Q).

Por lo tanto, **no podemos determinar si Tomás trajo pizza o no**.

La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué pasaría SI el loro estuviera en la jaula, pero como el loro NO está en la jaula, no podemos concluir nada sobre si Tomás trajo o no trajo pizza.

**Respuesta: No se puede determinar con la información dada si es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.**"
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Según lo que decía María, **no puedo afirmar con certeza que Marcos te dio un caramelo**.

María dijo: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo""

Sabemos que:
- Te comiste el brócoli ✓
- También te comiste la pasta (pero esto no es relevante para la condición de María)

La condición de María establece que SI te comes el brócoli, ENTONCES Marcos te dará un caramelo. Como efectivamente te comiste el brócoli, según la promesa de María, Marcos **debería** darte un caramelo.

Sin embargo, hay una diferencia importante entre:
- Lo que María dijo que Marcos **haría** (dar un caramelo si te comías el brócoli)
- Lo que Marcos **realmente hizo**

El contexto no nos dice si Marcos efectivamente cumplió con lo que María prometió en su nombre. Solo sabemos lo que María dijo que pasaría, no lo que realmente pasó.

Por lo tanto, según lo que decía María, Marcos debería haberte dado un caramelo, pero no podemos confirmar que esto realmente ocurrió."
S2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. Marcos no te dio un caramelo. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Según lo que decía María, la respuesta es **no**.

María afirmó: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"".

Según el contexto:
- Te comiste el brócoli ✓
- Marcos no te dio un caramelo ✗

Dado que cumpliste la condición (comerte el brócoli) pero no recibiste la consecuencia prometida (el caramelo de Marcos), lo que María dijo resultó ser falso.

Por lo tanto, según lo que decía María, NO es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo. De hecho, la realidad contradice lo que María afirmó."
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Según la lógica del enunciado de María, **no se puede determinar con certeza** si Marcos te dio un caramelo o no.

La afirmación de María es: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo""

Esto es una implicación lógica del tipo ""Si P, entonces Q"", donde:
- P = te comes el brócoli
- Q = Marcos te dará un caramelo

Como NO te has comido el brócoli (P es falso), la condición de la promesa no se cumplió. En lógica, cuando el antecedente (P) es falso, la implicación completa es verdadera independientemente de si Q es verdadero o falso.

En otras palabras:
- María NO prometió nada sobre qué pasaría si NO te comes el brócoli
- Marcos podría haberte dado el caramelo por otra razón, o podría no habértelo dado
- La declaración de María no nos da información sobre este caso

Por lo tanto, basándonos solo en lo que decía María, **no podemos saber** si Marcos te dio o no el caramelo."
S3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"".

La información disponible es:
- Los zorros están bailando (hecho confirmado)
- Las ardillas están comiendo (hecho confirmado)
- María dijo: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara""

Dado que los zorros SÍ están bailando, según lo que dijo María, **Irene** debería recibir una cámara. Sin embargo, la pregunta es sobre **Susana**, quien no se menciona en ninguna parte del contexto.

Por lo tanto, no hay información que permita saber si Susana recibió o no una cámara."
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara.

**La pregunta es:** ¿Es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?

Según el contexto, se nos dice explícitamente que ""**Irene no recibió una cámara**"".

La afirmación de María solo se refiere a Susana (no a Irene): dado que los zorros están bailando, según María, Susana debería recibir una cámara.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta es: **No, no es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara**. El contexto establece claramente que Irene no recibió una cámara."
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","Analizando la información proporcionada:

1. Los zorros NO están bailando
2. Las ardillas NO están comiendo (información irrelevante)
3. María dijo: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara""

Dado que los zorros NO están bailando, la condición de María no se cumple. Por lo tanto, según lo que dijo María, no podemos concluir que Irene reciba una cámara.

Además, la pregunta es sobre **Susana**, no sobre Irene. No hay ninguna información en el contexto sobre Susana recibiendo una cámara.

**Respuesta: No, no es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara.** No hay información en el contexto que mencione a Susana ni que indique que ella recibió una cámara."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"".

Lo que sabemos es:
- La televisión está encendida (hecho confirmado)
- María dijo: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""

Dado que la televisión efectivamente está encendida, y según la afirmación condicional de María, Mateo **hará** galletas. Sin embargo, la pregunta usa el tiempo pasado ""hizo"", mientras que la afirmación de María usa el tiempo futuro ""hará"".

Por lo tanto, basándome estrictamente en la información dada:
- Podemos afirmar que según María, Mateo **hará** galletas (porque la condición se cumple)
- Pero no podemos confirmar si ya las **hizo**, ya que eso depende de cuándo se cumplió la condición y cuánto tiempo ha pasado desde entonces."

**Información dada:**
- La televisión está encendida ✓
- La radio está encendida ✓
- Mateo NO hizo galletas ✓
- María dijo: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""

**Análisis:**
La afirmación de María establece una relación condicional:
- Si [la televisión está encendida] → entonces [Mateo hará galletas]

Sabemos que:
- La condición se cumple (la televisión SÍ está encendida)
- Por lo tanto, según María, Mateo debería hacer galletas
- Pero en la realidad, Mateo NO hizo galletas

**Respuesta:**
No, NO es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas. 

De hecho, los hechos contradicen lo que María había dicho. Aunque la televisión está encendida (lo cual según María debería resultar en que Mateo hiciera galletas), en realidad Mateo no hizo galletas."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Analizando la situación:

1. La televisión está apagada
2. María dijo: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""

Esta es una proposición condicional del tipo ""Si P, entonces Q"", donde:
- P = ""La televisión está encendida""
- Q = ""Mateo hará galletas""

Dado que la televisión está apagada (P es falso), **no podemos determinar con certeza si Mateo hizo galletas o no**.

La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué pasaría si la televisión estuviera encendida, pero no nos dice nada sobre qué pasa cuando la televisión está apagada.

S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Basándome en el contexto proporcionado:

**No puedo afirmar con certeza que Emma fue de morado.**

Razón: María dijo ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma **va a ir** de morado"" (tiempo futuro). El contexto confirma que el tiempo está soleado hoy, pero la pregunta usa el tiempo pasado ""**fue** de morado"", sugiriendo que se pregunta sobre algo que ya ocurrió.

No hay información en el contexto que confirme si Emma efectivamente fue de morado o no. Solo sabemos que según María, Emma tenía la intención de ir de morado si hacía sol, pero no sabemos si esto realmente sucedió."

**No, no es verdad que Emma fue de morado.**

El contexto establece claramente que ""Emma fue de verde"". 

María había predicho que ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"", y efectivamente el tiempo estaba soleado. Sin embargo, la predicción de María resultó ser incorrecta, ya que Emma fue de verde, no de morado.

Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Basándome en el contexto proporcionado, **no se puede determinar con certeza si Emma fue de morado**.

Aquí está mi razonamiento:

1. María estableció una condición: ""**Si** el tiempo está soleado, **entonces** Emma va a ir de morado""

2. El contexto indica que hoy el tiempo está **lluvioso** (no soleado)

3. Cuando tenemos una afirmación condicional del tipo ""Si A, entonces B"", y sabemos que A es falso (no está soleado), no podemos concluir nada sobre B (si Emma fue de morado o no)

4. La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué pasaría si estuviera soleado, pero no nos dice nada sobre qué hace Emma cuando está lluvioso

Por lo tanto, con la información disponible, no podemos afirmar si es verdad o no que Emma fue de morado."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Basándome en el contexto proporcionado:

- El parque infantil está vacío (hecho confirmado)
- María dijo: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie""

Según la lógica de lo que decía María, **sí, es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie**.

Esto se deduce porque:
1. La condición establecida por María era que el parque estuviera vacío
2. Esa condición se cumple (el parque está vacío)
3. Por lo tanto, según María, la consecuencia (que Júlia se haga un selfie) debería ocurrir

Sin embargo, es importante notar que esto es lo que se deduce ""según lo que decía María"", no necesariamente lo que ocurrió en la realidad."

S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","Basándome en la información proporcionada, **no puedo afirmar con certeza que Pablo recibió 50 euros**.

Aquí está mi razonamiento:

1. **Sabemos que**: El césped ha sido cortado (es un hecho confirmado)

2. **María dijo**: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""

3. **El problema es**: No sabemos quién cortó el césped. Aunque el césped está cortado, pudo haberlo cortado:
   - Pablo
   - Otra persona
   - María misma

4. La condición de María es específica: **Pablo** debe ser quien corte el césped para recibir los 50 euros.

Por lo tanto, sin información sobre quién realizó la acción de cortar el césped, no podemos concluir que Pablo recibió los 50 euros. Solo podríamos afirmarlo si supiéramos con certeza que Pablo fue quien cortó el césped."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","Analizando la información proporcionada:

**Hechos establecidos:**
- El césped ha sido cortado (pero no se especifica quién lo cortó)
- Las flores han sido regadas
- María dijo: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""

La afirmación de María establece una condición: Pablo recibe 50 euros SI Y SOLO SI Pablo corta el césped.

Sin embargo, el contexto NO confirma que Pablo fue quien cortó el césped. Solo sabemos que el césped fue cortado, pero pudo haberlo hecho:
- Pablo
- Otra persona
- Incluso María misma

**Conclusión:**
No se puede afirmar con certeza que Pablo recibió 50 euros, porque no tenemos información que confirme que él fue quien cortó el césped. 

Para que la afirmación ""Pablo recibió 50 euros"" sea verdadera según lo que dijo María, necesitaríamos confirmar que Pablo fue efectivamente quien cortó el césped, información que no está presente en el contexto dado."
