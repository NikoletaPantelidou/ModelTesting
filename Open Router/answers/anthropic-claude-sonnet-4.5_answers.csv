B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on what Mary says alone, we cannot determine with certainty that there is pizza in the oven.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: ""**If** John is hungry, **then** there is pizza in the oven.""

From the context, we know:
- John IS hungry (true)
- Mary's conditional: ""If hungry → then pizza in oven""

Since John is hungry (the condition is met), and Mary's statement is true, then according to her statement, there **is** pizza in the oven.

So **yes, based on Mary's statement being true and John being hungry, there is pizza in the oven.**

However, it's worth noting that Mary's statement could be true even if she's just making a logical claim without having checked the oven. But taking her statement at face value: yes, there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven.

**Here's why:**

The context clearly states as a **fact** that ""there is no pizza in the oven.""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven."" While John IS hungry (making the ""if"" part true), Mary's conditional statement contradicts the established facts. 

Mary's statement is simply **false** - it doesn't change the reality that there is no pizza in the oven. Just because someone says something doesn't make it true, especially when it contradicts the given facts."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, we cannot conclude that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** John is hungry, **then** there is pizza in the oven.""

Since John is **not** hungry, the condition (the ""if"" part) is false. When the condition of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the conclusion is true or false.

In logical terms:
- Mary said: ""John is hungry → pizza in oven""
- We know: John is NOT hungry
- Therefore: We cannot determine whether there is pizza in the oven or not

The pizza might or might not be in the oven - Mary's statement simply doesn't address what happens when John is not hungry."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

However, it's important to note **why** it's true: The aspirin is on the table because that's what the context directly tells us as a fact, NOT because of Mary's conditional statement.

Mary says: ""**If** Nicole's head hurts, **then** there is aspirin on the table.""

Since we know from the context that:
1. Nicole's head hurts (true)
2. Mary's conditional statement is assumed to be accurate

We can logically conclude that there is aspirin on the table (which confirms what we were already told in the context).

This is an example of *modus ponens*: If P then Q; P is true; therefore Q is true."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table.

**Here's why:**

The context explicitly states: ""there is no aspirin on the table.""

Mary's statement is a conditional claim: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""

However, Mary's statement being made doesn't change the actual facts. We know from the context that:
1. Nicole's head does hurt (fact)
2. There is no aspirin on the table (fact)

This means Mary's conditional statement is actually **false**. The antecedent (Nicole's head hurts) is true, but the consequent (there is aspirin on the table) is false, making the entire conditional statement false.

Mary is simply wrong or mistaken in what she says. The actual truth is that there is no aspirin on the table."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is aspirin on the table.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** Nicole's head hurts, **then** there is aspirin on the table.""

Since Nicole's head does **not** hurt, the condition (the ""if"" part) is false. When the condition of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about whether the conclusion is true or false.

In logical terms:
- Mary said: If P, then Q
- We know: P is false (Nicole's head does not hurt)
- Therefore: We cannot conclude anything about Q (whether aspirin is on the table)

The aspirin might be on the table, or it might not be—Mary's statement simply doesn't tell us either way."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, we cannot definitively conclude that there is water in the fridge.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: ""**If** Lucy is thirsty, **then** there is water in the fridge.""

To determine if there is water in the fridge based solely on Mary's conditional statement, we would need to know whether the condition (the ""if"" part) is true - that is, whether Lucy is actually thirsty.

**From the context**, we're told that Lucy IS thirsty. Therefore:
- Lucy is thirsty (TRUE)
- Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge""
- By modus ponens (logical reasoning), there IS water in the fridge

**So yes, based on Mary's statement combined with the fact that Lucy is thirsty, it is true that there is water in the fridge.**

(Note: The context also independently confirms there is water in the fridge, but Mary's conditional statement alone, given that Lucy is thirsty, allows us to conclude this as well.)"
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge.

**Here's why:**

The context explicitly states: ""there is no water in the fridge.""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** Lucy is thirsty, **then** there is water in the fridge.""

While Lucy IS thirsty (making the ""if"" part true), the reality is that there is NO water in the fridge. This means Mary's conditional statement is actually **false** - it doesn't match reality.

Mary claiming something doesn't make it true. The actual facts take precedence over Mary's statement. The fridge remains empty of water regardless of what Mary says."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is water in the fridge.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""

This can be written as: ""Lucy is thirsty → water in fridge""

However, we know that **Lucy is NOT thirsty**.

In logic, when the condition (antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself is vacuously true, but this tells us **nothing about whether the consequence is true or false**.

In other words:
- Mary's statement would be violated only if Lucy IS thirsty AND there is NO water in the fridge
- Since Lucy is NOT thirsty, Mary's statement is technically true regardless of whether there's water in the fridge or not

**Conclusion**: We cannot conclude that there is water in the fridge. There might be, or there might not be - Mary's statement doesn't tell us."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on what Mary says alone, we cannot conclusively determine that there is a charger in the drawer.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is: ""**If** Peter's phone is dead, **then** there is a charger in the drawer.""

This is a conditional statement (if P, then Q). From logic:
- If the condition is true (Peter's phone IS dead), then according to Mary's statement, there IS a charger in the drawer
- Mary's statement would be true in this case

Since the context tells us that Peter's phone IS dead, and Mary's conditional statement says that when the phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer, then **according to Mary's statement, yes, there is a charger in the drawer.**

However, it's worth noting that:
1. Mary's statement being true doesn't necessarily make it a fact - she could be wrong
2. The context independently confirms there IS a charger in the drawer (stated in the first sentence)

So the answer is: **Yes, according to Mary's statement combined with the fact that Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.**"
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Here's why:

**The facts we know:**
- Peter's phone is dead (given)
- There is no charger in the drawer (given)

**What Mary says:**
- ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = Peter's phone is dead
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer

Since we know:
- P is TRUE (the phone is dead)
- Q is FALSE (there is no charger in the drawer)

This means **Mary's statement is false**. The reality contradicts what Mary claimed.

The actual truth is that there is **no charger in the drawer**, regardless of what Mary says."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is actually a charger in the drawer.

Here's why:

Mary made a **conditional statement**: ""**If** Peter's phone is dead, **then** there is a charger in the drawer.""

This is a logical statement of the form ""If P, then Q"" where:
- P = Peter's phone is dead
- Q = There is a charger in the drawer

However, we know that Peter's phone is **fully charged** (not dead), so the condition P is **false**.

In logic, when the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the ""then"" part is true or false. The conditional statement is automatically true regardless of whether there's actually a charger in the drawer or not.

**Conclusion**: We cannot conclude that there is a charger in the drawer based solely on Mary's statement and the given information."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on what Mary says alone, we cannot conclude that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""

This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q). We know from the context that:
- P is true (the weather IS rainy)
- Mary's conditional states: P → Q

Since P is true AND Mary's conditional ""P → Q"" is stated, we can use modus ponens to conclude that Q must be true according to Mary's claim.

Therefore, **yes, based on what Mary says (combined with the fact that it is rainy), it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.**

Note: The context also independently confirms there IS an umbrella on the coat rack, but the question asks us to determine this based on Mary's statement, which we can do through logical deduction."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

**Here's why:**

The context clearly states that ""there is no umbrella on the coat rack."" This is a factual statement about reality.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack."" However, this is just what Mary *says* or *believes*.

Since we know from the context that:
1. The weather IS rainy (true)
2. There IS NO umbrella on the coat rack (true)

Mary's conditional statement is actually **false** - it doesn't match reality. When the antecedent of her conditional is true (rainy weather) but the consequent is false (no umbrella), her claim is incorrect.

So based on what Mary says, she *claims* there should be an umbrella on the coat rack, but the actual facts tell us there isn't one."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** the weather is rainy, **then** there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""

However, the weather is **sunny**, not rainy.

In logic, when the condition of an ""if-then"" statement is false (the weather is NOT rainy), the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the conclusion is true or false. The umbrella might or might not be on the coat rack - Mary's statement simply doesn't address what happens when the weather is sunny.

**Answer: We cannot determine from Mary's statement whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack.**"
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Based on what Mary says alone, we cannot definitively conclude that there is a pump in the garage.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** your tire is flat, **then** there is a pump in the garage.""

This tells us:
- IF the tire is flat → THEN there's a pump in the garage

However, Mary's conditional statement doesn't tell us whether the tire is actually flat. She's only describing what would follow IF it were flat.

**That said**, the context separately tells us that ""your tire IS flat"" and ""there IS a pump in the garage."" So:

1. **From the context**: Yes, there is a pump in the garage (stated as fact)
2. **From Mary's statement alone**: We cannot determine this without knowing if the tire is actually flat
3. **Combining both**: Since the tire is flat (given) AND Mary's conditional is true, then yes, there is a pump in the garage

The answer depends on whether you're asking about Mary's statement in isolation or Mary's statement combined with the given facts."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not true that there is a pump in the garage.

**Explanation:**

Mary made a conditional statement: ""If your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage.""

The context tells us:
1. Your tire IS flat (the condition is true)
2. There is NO pump in the garage (the consequence is false)

Since the tire is flat but there is no pump in the garage, Mary's statement is actually **false**. Her conditional claim doesn't match reality.

The fact that there is no pump in the garage is established by the context, regardless of what Mary claims. Mary's statement is simply incorrect."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is a pump in the garage.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** your tire is flat, **then** there is a pump in the garage.""

This can be written as: Flat tire → Pump in garage

However, we know that the tire is **not** flat.

In logic, when the condition (antecedent) of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the conditional statement itself is considered true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false. This means:
- Mary's statement tells us what would be true IF the tire were flat
- Since the tire is NOT flat, Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether there actually is a pump in the garage or not

The pump might be there, or it might not be there. Mary's statement simply doesn't give us that information."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot conclude** that there is a water can on the shelf.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is: ""**If** the plant is dry, **then** there is a water can on the shelf.""

This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, knowing that a conditional statement is true does NOT tell us whether either part is actually true in reality.

Mary is only describing a logical relationship - she's saying what *would be* the case if the plant is dry. She's not confirming that the plant actually IS dry.

**However**, the context separately tells us that:
- The plant IS dry (stated as fact)
- There IS a water can on the shelf (stated as fact)

So while there IS a water can on the shelf according to the context, this is true because the context directly states it as a fact, **not** because we can derive it from Mary's conditional statement alone.

If we were only given Mary's statement without the context, we couldn't conclude anything definite about whether there's actually a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.

**Here's why:**

The context explicitly states: ""there is no water can on the shelf.""

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** the plant is dry, **then** there is a water can on the shelf.""

However, Mary's statement being false doesn't change the actual facts given in the context. The context directly tells us there is no water can on the shelf.

In fact, Mary's conditional statement is false because:
- The plant IS dry (premise is true)
- There is NO water can on the shelf (conclusion is false)
- Therefore, her ""if-then"" statement is false

The actual state of affairs is what matters for answering whether there is a water can on the shelf, and the answer is definitively **no**."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on what Mary says, we **cannot determine** whether there is a water can on the shelf.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""**If** the plant is dry, **then** there is a water can on the shelf.""

In logical terms: If P (plant is dry) → then Q (water can on shelf)

We know that:
- The plant is **not** dry (P is false)

When the condition (P) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement tells us nothing about whether the conclusion (Q) is true or false. 

In other words:
- If the plant WERE dry, then yes, there would be a water can on the shelf
- But since the plant is NOT dry, Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the water can exists or not

**Answer: No, we cannot conclude that there is a water can on the shelf.** There might be one, or there might not be one - Mary's statement simply doesn't give us that information."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot definitively conclude that there is an iron in the closet.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: ""**If** George's shirt is wrinkled, **then** there is an iron in the closet.""

This is of the form: If P, then Q.

We know from the context that:
- George's shirt IS wrinkled (P is true)
- There actually IS an iron in the closet (stated in the context)

However, the question asks what we can conclude ""based on what Mary says.""

From Mary's conditional statement alone:
- If P is true (shirt is wrinkled), then according to her statement, Q must be true (iron in closet)
- Since P is true, we can use **modus ponens** to conclude Q is true

So yes, **based on Mary's statement combined with the fact that George's shirt is wrinkled, we can conclude there is an iron in the closet.**

Mary's statement, together with the observation that the shirt is wrinkled, logically entails that there is an iron in the closet."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either.

B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Based on what Mary says, **we cannot definitively conclude that there are books on the shelf.**

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a **conditional**: ""**If** Susy wants to read, **then** there are books on the shelf.""

This is of the form: If P, then Q.

We know from the context that:
- P is true (Susy wants to read)

When we have ""If P, then Q"" and we know P is true, we can logically conclude that Q is true (this is called *modus ponens*).

**However**, the question asks what we can conclude ""based on what Mary says"" - meaning based solely on Mary's conditional statement.

From Mary's conditional statement alone, without knowing whether Susy actually wants to read, we cannot conclude with certainty that there are books on the shelf. Mary only tells us what would be true *if* Susy wants to read.

**That said**, if we combine:
1. Mary's statement: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf""
2. The given fact: ""Susy wants to read""

Then yes, by modus ponens, we can conclude there are books on the shelf.

The answer depends on whether we're allowed to use the contextual information or only Mary's statement itself."

F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Based on the context provided, **yes, pizza appears to be more popular than pasta**.

The context explicitly states that ""people buy it more"" (referring to pizza), even though pizza is more expensive than pasta. This higher purchase frequency despite the higher price point is a clear indicator of greater popularity.

The additional fact that there is pizza in the fridge doesn't directly relate to the popularity question, but the purchasing behavior described does support the conclusion that pizza is more popular."

F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Based on the context provided, **yes, soda appears to be more in demand than water**.

The context explicitly states ""many choose soda"" despite water being healthier, which indicates that soda has higher demand among consumers. The fact that people are choosing the less healthy option (soda) over the healthier one (water) suggests a preference that drives demand toward soda.

The mention of water being in the freezer is just a factual statement about location and doesn't change the demand relationship established in the first sentence."
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","No, according to the context, water is not more in demand than soda.

The context explicitly states that ""Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda."" This indicates that despite water being the healthier option, more people choose to consume soda, making soda more in demand than water."

The context explicitly states that ""people eat burgers more often"" (compared to sushi), which is a strong indicator of popularity. Popularity is typically measured by how frequently or widely something is consumed or chosen by people.

The fact that sushi is healthier than burgers, or that there happens to be sushi on the table in this particular scenario, doesn't change the general pattern that burgers are eaten more frequently, suggesting they are more popular overall."

The context explicitly states that ""most people prefer walking"" (compared to running), which indicates that walking is more popular despite running being better for fitness.

The fact that there is a runner on the track doesn't change this general preference - it just indicates that at least one person is running at that moment, but doesn't contradict the statement about overall popularity."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on the context provided, I cannot definitively say that Thomas brought pizza.

Here's why:

Mary stated a **conditional**: ""**If** the parrot is in the cage, **then** Thomas will bring pizza.""

We know that:
- The parrot IS in the cage (the condition is met)
- According to Mary's statement, this means Thomas **will** bring pizza

However, there's an important distinction:
- Mary's statement tells us what **will happen** (future tense)
- The question asks if Thomas **brought** pizza (past tense - whether it actually happened)

So while Mary's conditional logic suggests Thomas **should** bring pizza (since the condition is satisfied), we don't have explicit confirmation that he **actually did** bring it. Mary's statement is a prediction or claim about what will happen, but we're not told whether it actually occurred.

**Answer: We cannot confirm it's true that Thomas brought pizza** - we only know that according to Mary's statement, he should/will bring pizza."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza.

According to the context, ""Thomas did not bring pizza"" - this is stated directly as a fact.

Mary's statement was: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""

Since the parrot IS in the cage, but Thomas did NOT bring pizza, this means Mary's conditional statement turned out to be false/incorrect. Her prediction did not match what actually happened."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on the context, **we cannot conclude that Thomas brought pizza**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza""

This is a conditional statement of the form: **If P, then Q**
- P = the parrot is in the cage
- Q = Thomas will bring pizza

We're told that **the parrot is NOT in the cage**.

When the condition (P) of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about whether Q is true or false. This is a logical principle: a false antecedent doesn't allow us to conclude anything about the consequent.

**Therefore:** We cannot determine whether Thomas brought pizza or not based solely on Mary's statement and the given information."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based solely on what Mary said, we cannot conclusively determine that Mark gave you a candy.

Here's why:

**What we know:**
- You finished your broccoli (condition met)
- Mary stated a conditional: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy""

**What we can infer:**
- According to Mary's statement, Mark *should* give you a candy (since you fulfilled the condition)
- Mary's statement expresses an expectation or promise about what Mark will do

**However:**
- We don't have information about whether Mark actually followed through
- Mary's statement describes what Mark ""will"" do, but we aren't told what actually happened after you finished your broccoli

**Answer:** Based on Mary's statement and the fact that you finished your broccoli, Mark is *supposed to* give you a candy, but we cannot confirm whether he actually did without additional information about what occurred afterward."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"".

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""

You did finish your broccoli, which means the condition was met. According to Mary's statement, this means Mark *should* give you a candy.

However, the context only tells us that:
- You finished your broccoli ✓
- Mary did NOT give you a candy ✓
- (No information about whether Mark gave you a candy)

So while Mary's statement implies that Mark would give you a candy (since you finished your broccoli), we have no actual information confirming whether Mark did or didn't give you one. The fact that Mary didn't give you a candy is consistent with her statement, since she said *Mark* would give it, not her.

**Answer: Unknown/Cannot be determined from the given information**"

Mary's statement was a conditional: ""**If** you finish your broccoli, **then** Mark will give you a candy.""

Since you didn't finish your broccoli (the condition was not met), Mark would not give you a candy according to Mary's statement."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on the information given, **we cannot definitively conclude that Susan got a camera**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""

We know that:
- The foxes ARE dancing (this is confirmed)
- Therefore, according to Mary's conditional statement, Susan WILL get a camera

However, there's an important distinction:
- Mary's statement tells us what WILL happen (future tense)
- The question asks if Susan GOT a camera (past tense - implying it already happened)

So while Mary's statement predicts that Susan will get a camera (since the condition is met), we don't have explicit confirmation that this has already occurred. We can reasonably infer it should happen or is happening, but strictly speaking, we cannot confirm it as a completed fact based solely on what was stated."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on what Mary said, **yes, it should be true that Susan got a camera**.

Here's the reasoning:
- Mary stated: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera""
- The context confirms: ""The foxes are dancing""
- Therefore, according to Mary's conditional statement, Susan will get a camera

This follows the logical form: If P, then Q. P is true. Therefore, Q is true."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on what Mary said, **we cannot determine whether Susan got a camera or not**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""

This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q.
- P = the foxes are dancing
- Q = Susan will get a camera

We're told that the foxes are NOT dancing (P is false).

When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement tells us nothing about whether the ""then"" part is true or false. Susan might have gotten a camera for some other reason, or she might not have gotten one at all.

So the answer is: **We cannot conclude that Susan got a camera, nor can we conclude that she didn't get one.** Mary's statement simply doesn't apply to this situation."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based solely on what Mary said, we cannot definitively conclude that Matthew **did** bake cookies.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""

This is a conditional statement (if-then). We know that:
- The TV is on (the condition is met)
- Therefore, according to Mary's statement, Matthew **will** bake cookies

However, there's an important distinction:
- Mary's statement tells us what **will happen** (future tense or a prediction)
- The question asks whether Matthew **baked** cookies (past tense, asking about what actually happened)

So while Mary's conditional statement indicates that Matthew *should* bake cookies (since the TV is on), we don't have direct confirmation that he actually *did* bake them. Mary's statement expresses an expectation or prediction, but we'd need additional information to confirm whether Matthew actually followed through and baked the cookies.

**Short answer:** According to Mary's rule, Matthew *should* bake cookies (since the TV is on), but we cannot confirm with certainty that he actually did."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.

According to the context, ""Matthew did not bake cookies."" This is stated as a fact.

While Mary said ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies,"" and the TV is indeed on, Mary's statement turned out to be incorrect. Her prediction did not match what actually happened - Matthew did not bake cookies despite the TV being on."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on the given information, **we cannot determine whether Matthew baked cookies or not**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies""

This is a conditional statement of the form: ""If P, then Q""
- P = ""The TV is on""
- Q = ""Matthew will bake cookies""

We're told that the TV is **off** (P is false).

When the condition (P) of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about whether Q happened or not. Mary's statement only tells us what would happen if the TV were on. Since the TV is off, her statement doesn't apply, and Matthew may or may not have baked cookies for other reasons.

So the answer is: **No, we cannot conclude that Matthew baked cookies** - but we also cannot conclude that he didn't. We simply don't have enough information."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on the information given, **we cannot definitively say that Emma wore purple**.

Here's why:

Mary stated a **conditional**: ""**If** the weather is sunny, **then** Emma will wear purple.""

We know:
- The weather IS sunny (the condition is met)
- According to Mary's statement, this means Emma **will** wear purple

However, there are important caveats:

1. **Mary's statement might not be accurate** - Just because Mary said this doesn't mean it's necessarily true. She could be wrong about Emma's clothing choices.

2. **The logic follows only if we trust Mary's statement** - If we assume Mary's conditional statement is reliable, then yes, the sunny weather would mean Emma wore/will wear purple.

So the answer depends on whether we're asked:
- What Mary's statement **implies**: Yes, it implies Emma wore purple (since it's sunny)
- What we can **know for certain**: No, we cannot be certain without additional confirmation

If this is a logic puzzle where we take Mary's statement as fact, then **yes, Emma wore purple** because the condition (sunny weather) was satisfied."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on what Mary said, **no, it is not true that Emma wore purple.**

Here's why:

Mary stated a conditional: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""

The facts show:
- The weather IS sunny (the condition is met)
- Emma IS wearing green (not purple)

According to Mary's statement, if the weather is sunny, then Emma should be wearing purple. However, Emma is actually wearing green. This means that Mary's prediction/statement turned out to be **incorrect** - it does not match reality.

So while Mary *said* Emma would wear purple (given sunny weather), Emma actually wore green. Therefore, it is false that Emma wore purple."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on the context provided, **we cannot determine whether Emma wore purple or not**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""

This is a conditional statement in the form ""If A, then B"" where:
- A = the weather is sunny
- B = Emma will wear purple

However, we're told that today the weather is **rainy** (not sunny), so the condition (A) is **false**.

When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about what actually happens. Mary only told us what Emma would do if it were sunny - she didn't say anything about what Emma would wear when it's rainy.

Therefore, Emma may or may not have worn purple. We simply don't have enough information to answer the question."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based solely on the information provided, **we cannot definitively conclude that Angela took a selfie**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was: ""**If** the playground is empty, Angela **will** take a selfie.""

This is a conditional statement (if-then). We know that:
- The playground IS empty (the condition is met)
- Mary said Angela WILL take a selfie (future tense)

However, there are important limitations:

1. **No confirmation of action**: We're not told that Angela actually did take a selfie, only what Mary predicted would happen.

2. **Reliability unknown**: We don't know if Mary's prediction is accurate or reliable.

3. **Timing unclear**: The ""will"" suggests future action, but we're not told whether that future moment has occurred yet.

**If we assume:**
- Mary's statement is reliable/true, AND
- Sufficient time has passed for Angela to act

**Then yes**, we could reasonably infer that Angela took a selfie.

But strictly speaking, without explicit confirmation that Angela actually took the selfie, we only know what Mary predicted would happen, not what actually happened."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"".

The context explicitly states: ""Angela did not take a selfie.""

Mary's statement was a conditional: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie."" While the playground is indeed empty (which satisfies the ""if"" condition), the actual outcome contradicts Mary's prediction. Angela did not take a selfie, which means Mary's prediction turned out to be incorrect."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.

**Reasoning:**

Mary stated: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""

This is a conditional statement of the form: If P (playground is empty), then Q (Angela takes a selfie).

However, we know from the context that **the playground is crowded** (not empty).

Since the condition (playground being empty) is **false**, we cannot conclude anything about whether Angela took a selfie or not. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the playground were empty, but it doesn't tell us what happens when the playground is crowded.

Therefore, we cannot affirm that Angela took a selfie based on the given information."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based solely on what Mary said, we **cannot conclude with certainty** that Paul got 50 euros.

Here's why:

**What we know:**
- The lawn has been mowed
- Mary said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros""

**What we don't know:**
- **Who** mowed the lawn

Mary's statement creates a conditional: IF Paul mows the lawn, THEN he gets 50 euros.

However, we're only told that the lawn has been mowed, not that *Paul* specifically mowed it. Someone else could have mowed it.

**Conclusion:** 
- If Paul mowed the lawn → then yes, he got 50 euros (according to Mary's statement)
- If someone else mowed the lawn → then no, Paul didn't get 50 euros

Without knowing who mowed the lawn, we cannot determine whether Paul got 50 euros."

Mary's statement was: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros.""

While we know the lawn has been mowed, we're told Paul did not get the 50 euros. This means either:
1. Paul did not mow the lawn (someone else did), or
2. Mary did not follow through on her promise

Either way, the fact remains that Paul did not get 50 euros."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.

**Reasoning:**

1. Mary's statement establishes a conditional: ""**If** Paul mows the lawn, **then** he will get 50 euros""

2. The context tells us that ""the lawn has not been mowed""

3. Since the lawn has not been mowed, we can conclude that Paul did not mow the lawn

4. Therefore, the condition for Paul getting 50 euros was never met

5. We cannot conclude that Paul got 50 euros (in fact, the evidence suggests he did not)

Mary's statement only guarantees payment **if** Paul mows the lawn. Since the lawn remains unmowed, there's no basis to claim Paul received the 50 euros."

**The issue:**
Mary's statement is a conditional (if-then) statement about what **will happen** in the future. Since the dog is indeed playing, Mary's condition is met, which means according to her statement, Anthony **will** read a book.

However, the question asks if Anthony **read** a book (past tense), but we have no information confirming whether this actually happened. Mary's statement tells us what *should* or *will* happen, but we aren't told whether it actually occurred.

**Conclusion:**
- If we take Mary's statement as a reliable prediction/rule, then yes, Anthony should read/will read a book
- But we cannot confirm with certainty that he *already read* a book, as this hasn't been explicitly stated in the context"

**No, no és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn.**

El context estableix clarament que ""no hi ha pizza al forn"". El fet que la Maria digui que hi hauria d'haver-hi (si en Joan té gana) no canvia la realitat dels fets.

**No, no és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula.**

El context indica clarament que ""no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". 

L'afirmació de la Maria és una implicació condicional (Si P, llavors Q), però aquesta afirmació és **falsa** perquè:

Del context sabem que:
- **P és FALS** (La Núria NO té mal de cap)

Quan la condició d'una implicació condicional és falsa (P és fals), la implicació és veritat independentment de si Q és veritat o fals. Però això **no ens diu res sobre si Q és veritat o no**.

Analitzem la situació amb lògica:

**Fets del context:**
- La Llúcia té set (VERITAT)
- No hi ha aigua a la nevera (VERITAT)
- No hi ha suc de poma al rebost (VERITAT)

**Afirmació de la Maria:**
""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua a la nevera""

- P = La Llúcia té set
- Q = Hi ha aigua a la nevera

**Avaluació:**
- P és VERITAT (la Llúcia té set)
- Q és FALS (no hi ha aigua a la nevera)

Per tant, l'afirmació de la Maria (Si P → Q) és **FALSA**, perquè quan l'antecedent és veritat però el conseqüent és fals, la implicació és falsa.

Quan la condició d'un enunciat condicional (""si... aleshores..."") **no es compleix** (la Llúcia no té set), no podem deduir res sobre la conclusió (si hi ha aigua o no a la nevera).

**Exemples per entendre-ho:**
- Podria haver-hi aigua a la nevera igualment

## Avaluació de l'afirmació de la Maria

L'afirmació de la Maria és una implicació condicional:
- **Antecedent (P)**: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria → **VERITAT** (segons el context)
- **Conseqüent (Q)**: Hi ha un carregador al calaix → **FALS** (segons el context)

Quan P és veritat però Q és fals, la implicació ""Si P, llavors Q"" és **FALSA**.

## Resposta

**NO, no és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix.**

El context indica clarament que ""no hi ha cap carregador al calaix"". Per tant, l'afirmació de la Maria és incorrecta, ja que el mòbil del Pere realment no té bateria (complint l'antecedent), però no hi ha cap carregador al calaix (contradicció amb el conseqüent)."

Això és una implicació condicional: Si A (no té bateria) → Llavors B (hi ha carregador)

Com que la condició A és **falsa** (el mòbil SÍ té bateria), no es compleix la premissa de la implicació. Per tant, no podem deduir res sobre si hi ha o no un carregador al calaix basant-nos només en l'afirmació de la Maria.

Aquesta és una frase condicional. La Maria estableix una relació entre dues situacions, però com que el context ens diu explícitament que ""**La Susanna no vol llegir**"", la condició del ""si"" no es compleix.

En lògica, quan tenim una implicació condicional ""Si A, llavors B"" i sabem que A és fals, no podem deduir res sobre B. Per tant, no podem determinar si realment hi ha llibres a l'estanteria o no, basant-nos només en l'afirmació de la Maria."

**Raonament:**

1. La Maria va dir: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza""

Analitzem la informació:

**Fets:**
- El lloro NO és a la gàbia
- El gos NO és a la gossera
- La Maria va dir: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza""

**Estructura lògica:**
La frase de la Maria és una implicació condicional:
- **P → Q** (Si P, aleshores Q)
- P = ""El lloro és a la gàbia""
- Q = ""El Tomàs portarà pizza""

**Avaluació:**
Sabem que P és **fals** (el lloro NO és a la gàbia).

Quan l'antecedent d'una implicació és fals, la implicació completa és **veritablement satisfeta** (vacuously true), però això **NO ens diu res** sobre el conseqüent Q.

**Resposta:**

**No, no podem saber si és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza.**

La condició de la Maria només estableix què passarà SI el lloro està a la gàbia. Com que el lloro NO hi és, la condició no s'activa i no tenim informació sobre si el Tomàs ha portat pizza o no. Podria haver-la portat per altres raons, o potser no l'ha portada."

- La condició de la Maria només es compleix **si el Pau** és qui ha tallat la gespa

### Conclusió:
**No podem afirmar** que el Pau hagi rebut 50 euros perquè:
- No tenim informació que confirmi que va ser el Pau qui va tallar la gespa
- Només sabem que la gespa està tallada, no per qui

Per tant, la resposta és: **No necessàriament** o **informació insuficient**."

Tot i que:
- La gespa ha estat tallada
- La Maria havia dit que si el Pau tallava la gespa, rebria 50 euros

El fet és que el Pau **no ha rebut** els 50 euros. Això podria significar que:
- Potser algú altre va tallar la gespa (no el Pau)
- O bé la Maria no va complir la seva promesa

Però la resposta clara a la pregunta és: **No, el Pau no ha rebut 50 euros**."

**No, no és veritat que el Pau hagi rebut 50 euros.**

## Raonament:

1. La Maria va establir una condició: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros""

2. El context ens informa que **la gespa no ha estat tallada**

3. Per tant, la condició necessària (tallar la gespa) **no s'ha complert**

4. Si la condició no s'ha complert, el Pau no pot haver rebut els 50 euros (segons el que diu la Maria)

**Informació donada:**
- El gos NO està jugant

- La Maria va dir: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre""

**Anàlisi lògica:**

La condició de la Maria és: ""Si el gos està jugant → l'Antoni llegirà un llibre""

Aquesta és una implicació condicional. Però com que el gos NO està jugant, **l'antecedent de la condició és fals**.

Quan l'antecedent d'una implicació condicional és fals, la implicació és sempre veritat independentment del conseqüent, però **no ens diu res sobre si el conseqüent és veritat o fals**.

**Resposta:**

**No podem saber** si l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre o no. 

La condició de la Maria només ens diu què passaria SI el gos estigués jugant. Com que el gos NO està jugant, la condició no s'activa i no tenim informació sobre si l'Antoni ha llegit o no el llibre. Podria haver-lo llegit per altres raons, o podria no haver-lo llegit."

Dati di fatto:

## Risposta

**No, non è vero che c'è della pizza in forno.**

Il contesto afferma chiaramente che ""non c'è della pizza in forno"". Questo è un dato di fatto.

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"") è quindi **falsa**, perché:
- La premessa è vera (Gianni ha fame)
- Ma la conseguenza è falsa (non c'è pizza in forno)

Un'implicazione logica ""Se A allora B"" è falsa quando A è vero ma B è falso, ed è esattamente questo il caso.

**Spiegazione:**

Il contesto ci dice esplicitamente che:

Maria ha fatto un'affermazione condizionale: ""**Se** la pianta è secca, **allora** c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale.""

Tuttavia, dal contesto sappiamo che **la pianta è rigogliosa** (quindi non è secca).

Poiché la condizione ""la pianta è secca"" è **falsa**, non possiamo dedurre nulla sulla presenza o assenza dell'annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. Maria ha specificato cosa accade solo nel caso in cui la pianta fosse secca, ma non ha detto nulla sul caso in cui la pianta sia rigogliosa.

B9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. C'è anche un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"".

- B = ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale

Dal punto di vista logico, sappiamo che A è vero (Susanna vuole leggere), quindi seguendo il condizionale di Maria, possiamo dedurre che B è vero (ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale).

Tuttavia, è importante notare che:
- Il contesto iniziale afferma **indipendentemente** che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale

S5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Oggi il tempo è soleggiato. Inoltre, non c'è vento. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Emma si è vestita di viola?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non possiamo essere certi** che Emma si sia vestita di viola.

- Secondo l'affermazione di Maria, questo implica che Emma si vestirà di viola

Quindi, **seguendo la logica dell'affermazione di Maria**, la risposta sarebbe: **Sì, Emma si è vestita di viola**.

Tuttavia, bisogna notare che:
1. Questa è solo una previsione/affermazione di Maria
2. Non abbiamo una conferma diretta di come Emma si sia effettivamente vestita

- Emma si è vestita di verde (fatto)

Maria aveva previsto che ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola"".

Nonostante il tempo sia effettivamente soleggiato, Emma si è vestita di **verde**, non di viola. Quindi la previsione di Maria si è rivelata **sbagliata**.

Secondo quanto affermato da Maria:
- **Condizione**: ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola""
- **Situazione reale**: Il tempo è piovoso e ventoso

## Risposta

**No, non possiamo affermare che Emma si è vestita di viola.**

La condizione posta da Maria (""se il tempo è soleggiato"") **non è soddisfatta**, dato che il tempo è piovoso. Quindi l'affermazione di Maria non ci permette di concludere nulla su come si sia vestita Emma.

In termini logici:
- Maria ha detto: Tempo soleggiato → Emma si veste di viola
- Realtà: Tempo NON soleggiato (piovoso)
- Conclusione: Non possiamo dedurre nulla sul colore dei vestiti di Emma

Emma potrebbe essersi vestita di viola oppure no, ma non lo sappiamo basandoci solo su ciò che ha detto Maria."

**Spiegazione:**

1. Maria ha detto: ""Se il parco giochi è vuoto, Angela si farà un selfie""
2. Il contesto ci dice che: ""Il parco giochi è vuoto""
3. Quindi, secondo la condizione stabilita da Maria, la conseguenza è che Angela si farà un selfie

Ecco il ragionamento:

1. **Fatto**: Il parco giochi è vuoto (dato nel contesto)

- Se ci basiamo **solo sull'affermazione di Maria**: Sì, Angela si è fatta un selfie

Dalla dichiarazione di Maria: **""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro""**

Questa è una condizione del tipo: **Se P → allora Q**
- P = Paolo taglia il prato
- Q = Paolo riceve 50 euro

## Cosa sappiamo dal contesto:

1. Il prato è stato tagliato (ma non sappiamo chi l'ha tagliato)
2. Paolo NON ha ricevuto 50 euro

## Ragionamento logico:

Se Paolo avesse tagliato il prato, secondo quanto detto da Maria, avrebbe dovuto ricevere 50 euro.

Ma sappiamo che Paolo **non ha ricevuto** 50 euro.

Applicando il **modus tollens**: se Q è falso (Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro), allora P deve essere falso (Paolo non ha tagliato il prato).

- Maria ha detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro""

La condizione posta da Maria è chiara: Paolo riceve 50 euro **solo se** taglia il prato.

María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","# Análisis de la situación

**Contexto real:**
- El tiempo está lluvioso ✓
- NO hay paraguas en el paragüero ✗

**Lo que dice María:**
""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero""

**Respuesta:**

**No, NO es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero.**

El contexto establece claramente que ""no hay paraguas en el paragüero"". Esto es un hecho de la situación.

Lo que María dice es una afirmación condicional (si... entonces...), pero esta afirmación resulta ser **falsa** porque:
- La condición se cumple: el tiempo SÍ está lluvioso
- Pero la consecuencia NO se cumple: NO hay paraguas en el paragüero

Por lo tanto, la afirmación de María es incorrecta o falsa. La realidad contradice lo que ella afirma."
B5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está despejado. Hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","# Análisis

Según lo que dice María, ella afirma:
**""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero""**

Esto es una proposición condicional de la forma: **""Si P, entonces Q""**
- P = ""el tiempo está lluvioso""
- Q = ""hay un paraguas en el paragüero""

## Datos que conocemos:
- El tiempo está **despejado** (NO lluvioso)
- Hay un chubasquero en el coche

## Respuesta:

**No podemos saber si es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero.**

### Explicación:
La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué ocurre **cuando llueve** (entonces hay paraguas). Pero como el tiempo está **despejado**, la condición del ""si"" no se cumple.

Cuando la condición de un condicional no se cumple, no podemos concluir nada sobre el consecuente. Es decir:
- Podría haber un paraguas en el paragüero (y la afirmación de María seguiría siendo verdadera)
- Podría NO haber un paraguas en el paragüero (y la afirmación de María también seguiría siendo verdadera)

La afirmación de María no proporciona información sobre qué hay en el paragüero cuando el tiempo está despejado."
B6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. También hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Analicemos esto paso a paso:

**Información del contexto:**
- La rueda del coche está pinchada (VERDADERO)
- Hay una bomba de aire en el garaje (VERDADERO - según el contexto)

**Afirmación de María:**
""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje""

**Análisis lógico:**

María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si P, entonces Q""
- P = la rueda del coche está pinchada
- Q = hay una bomba de aire en el garaje

Sin embargo, la pregunta es importante: ¿podemos deducir que Q es verdad **solo a partir de lo que dice María**?

Desde el punto de vista de la lógica formal:
- Sabemos que P es verdadero (la rueda está pinchada)
- María afirma ""Si P, entonces Q""
- Por **modus ponens**: Si P es verdadero y ""Si P entonces Q"" es verdadero, entonces Q es verdadero

## Respuesta:

**No, NO es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.**

El contexto establece claramente que ""no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje"". Este es un hecho de la realidad descrita.

Lo que dice María es una **afirmación condicional falsa**. María afirma que ""si P, entonces Q"" (si rueda pinchada → bomba en garaje), pero:

S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","Basándome en el contexto proporcionado, **no se puede determinar** si Susana recibió una cámara.

Aquí está el razonamiento:

1. **Lo que sabemos del contexto:**
   - Los zorros NO están bailando
   - Las ardillas NO están comiendo
   - María dijo: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara""

2. **Análisis de la declaración de María:**
   - Es una declaración condicional: ""Si P, entonces Q""
   - P = los zorros están bailando (FALSO)
   - Q = Irene recibirá una cámara
   - Cuando el antecedente (P) es falso, la declaración condicional no nos dice nada sobre el consecuente

3. **Sobre Susana:**
   - El contexto menciona a **Irene**, no a Susana
   - No hay ninguna información sobre Susana en el texto proporcionado

**Respuesta:** No hay información suficiente para determinar si Susana recibió una cámara. Además, la declaración de María se refiere a Irene, no a Susana."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, **no podemos estar seguros** de que Mateo hizo galletas.

Según lo que dijo María: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""

Lo que sabemos:
- La televisión está encendida ✓
- Esto cumple la condición del ""si"" en la afirmación de María

Sin embargo:
- María dijo que Mateo ""**hará**"" galletas (tiempo futuro)
- No tenemos información que confirme que Mateo efectivamente **hizo** las galletas

La afirmación de María establece una intención o predicción, pero el contexto no nos dice si esto realmente sucedió. Para poder afirmar que ""Mateo hizo galletas"" necesitaríamos información adicional que lo confirme."
S4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. Mateo no hizo galletas. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, no es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas.

Según el contexto:
- La televisión está encendida (verdadero)
- Mateo NO hizo galletas (verdadero)
- María dijo: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""

Lo que María dijo resultó ser **falso**. Aunque la condición se cumplió (la televisión está encendida), la consecuencia que ella predijo no ocurrió (Mateo no hizo galletas).

Por lo tanto, según la realidad de lo que pasó, Mateo no hizo galletas."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, **no podemos afirmar que Mateo hizo galletas**.

Analicemos la lógica:

- **Condición de María**: ""Si la televisión está encendida → Mateo hará galletas""
- **Situación real**: La televisión está apagada

En lógica condicional, cuando el antecedente (la televisión está encendida) es **falso**, no podemos concluir nada sobre el consecuente (si Mateo hizo o no galletas). 

La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué pasaría **si** la televisión estuviera encendida. Como está apagada, no se cumple la condición, y por lo tanto no sabemos si Mateo hizo galletas o no. Podría haberlas hecho por otra razón, o podría no haberlas hecho.

**Respuesta**: No es verdad que necesariamente Mateo hizo galletas (no hay información suficiente para afirmarlo)."
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Según lo que dijo María, **sí, es verdad que Emma fue de morado**.

**Razonamiento:**

1. María estableció una condición: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado""
2. El contexto confirma que: ""Hoy el tiempo está soleado""
3. Por lo tanto, se cumple la condición del condicional
4. Según la lógica de lo que dijo María, Emma va (o fue) de morado

**Nota:** La respuesta se basa estrictamente en seguir la lógica de lo que María había dicho, asumiendo que su afirmación es correcta."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, no es verdad que Emma fue de morado.

Según el contexto:
- Emma fue de verde (esto es un hecho establecido)
- María había predicho que si el tiempo estaba soleado, Emma iría de morado
- El tiempo efectivamente está soleado

Aunque se cumplió la condición que María mencionó (el tiempo soleado), la realidad es que Emma fue de verde, no de morado. Esto significa que la predicción de María resultó ser incorrecta."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, **no podemos afirmar que sea verdad que Emma fue de morado**.

Según lo que dijo María, la condición era: ""**Si** el tiempo está soleado, **entonces** Emma va a ir de morado"".

Sin embargo, el contexto indica que hoy el tiempo está **lluvioso** (no soleado). Por lo tanto:

- La condición planteada por María NO se cumple (el tiempo no está soleado)
- No podemos concluir nada sobre si Emma fue o no de morado basándonos únicamente en lo que dijo María

María solo estableció qué pasaría SI hacía sol. Como no hace sol, su afirmación no nos permite determinar si Emma fue de morado o no."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Basándome en la información proporcionada:

**No podemos afirmar con certeza que Júlia se hizo un selfie.**

Aquí está el razonamiento:

- María dijo: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie""
- El parque infantil **está** vacío (esto se confirma en el contexto)

Según la lógica condicional de lo que dijo María, si se cumple la condición (parque vacío), entonces se debería cumplir la consecuencia (Júlia se hará un selfie).

**Sin embargo**, la pregunta usa el tiempo pasado ""se **hizo**"" mientras que María habló en futuro ""se **hará**"". El contexto no nos confirma explícitamente si Júlia efectivamente se hizo el selfie, solo nos dice que según María, debería hacérselo dado que el parque está vacío.

**Respuesta práctica**: Según lo que decía María y dado que el parque está vacío, **se esperaría que Júlia se haga/hiciera un selfie**, pero técnicamente no tenemos confirmación directa de que lo haya hecho."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Según lo que decía María, **sí, debería ser verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie**.

**Razonamiento:**

1. María dijo: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie""
2. El contexto nos dice que el parque infantil está vacío
3. Por lo tanto, según la lógica de lo que María afirmó, Júlia se hará un selfie

**Sin embargo**, hay una contradicción en el contexto: el texto también nos dice explícitamente que ""Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie"".

Esto significa que **la predicción de María resultó ser falsa**. Aunque según lo que María decía debería ser verdad, en la realidad no lo fue. Júlia no se hizo el selfie a pesar de que el parque estaba vacío."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No, no es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie.

**Explicación:**

Según María: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie""

Esto es una condición del tipo: Si A → entonces B

- A = el parque infantil está vacío
- B = Júlia se hará un selfie

Sin embargo, el contexto nos dice que **el parque infantil está lleno** (no vacío).

Como la condición necesaria (parque vacío) NO se cumple, no podemos concluir que Júlia se hizo un selfie. La afirmación de María solo especifica qué pasaría SI el parque estuviera vacío, pero dado que está lleno, no sabemos qué hizo Júlia basándonos únicamente en lo que dijo María."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No, **no es necesariamente verdad** que Pablo recibió 50 euros.

**Análisis:**

Lo que sabemos:
- El césped ha sido cortado (hecho confirmado)
- María dijo: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""

Lo que NO sabemos:
- **Quién cortó el césped** - El contexto solo dice que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero no especifica que fue Pablo quien lo hizo.

**Conclusión:**
Para que Pablo reciba los 50 euros, se debe cumplir la condición de que **Pablo** sea quien cortó el césped. Como esto no está confirmado en el contexto, no podemos afirmar que Pablo recibió los 50 euros. Es posible que otra persona haya cortado el césped."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No, **no podemos afirmar con certeza** que Pablo recibió 50 euros.

**Razón:**

Según lo que dijo María: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""

Lo que sabemos del contexto:
- El césped ha sido cortado ✓
- Pero **no se especifica quién lo cortó**

Para que Pablo reciba los 50 euros se necesita cumplir la condición: que **Pablo** sea quien cortó el césped. Como no tenemos esa información confirmada (solo sabemos que el césped está cortado, pero no por quién), no podemos concluir que Pablo recibió el dinero.

Es posible que:
- Pablo lo cortó → recibiría los 50 euros
- Otra persona lo cortó → Pablo no recibiría nada

**Respuesta:** No es posible determinar si Pablo recibió 50 euros con la información proporcionada."
S7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped no ha sido cortado. Además, las flores no han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","# Análisis

Según el contexto:

1. **El césped no ha sido cortado** (hecho establecido)
2. María dijo: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"" (condicional)

## Respuesta:

**No, no es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros.**

**Razón:** El césped no ha sido cortado, lo que significa que Pablo no cumplió la condición necesaria (cortar el césped) para recibir los 50 euros. 

La afirmación de María establece un condicional: ""Si P (Pablo corta el césped), entonces Q (recibirá 50 euros)"". Como P no ocurrió (el césped NO fue cortado), no se puede concluir que Q ocurrió. De hecho, lo más lógico es inferir que Pablo no recibió los 50 euros porque no cumplió con su parte."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Basándome en la información proporcionada, **no podemos afirmar con certeza que Antonio leyó un libro**.

Analicemos:

1. **Lo que sabemos es cierto:**
   - El perro está jugando (hecho confirmado)
   - María dijo: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro""

2. **Lo que podemos inferir:**
   - Según la afirmación condicional de María, como el perro ESTÁ jugando, entonces Antonio LEERÁ un libro (futuro)

3. **El problema:**
   - La pregunta usa el pasado: ""¿Antonio **leyó** un libro?""
   - La condición de María indica que Antonio **leerá** (futuro)
   - No tenemos información sobre si Antonio efectivamente ya leyó el libro

**Conclusión:** Según María, Antonio *debería leer* o *va a leer* un libro (ya que se cumplió la condición), pero no tenemos confirmación de que ya lo haya hecho. La respuesta sería **no podemos confirmarlo** con la información dada."
S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro.

Analicemos la situación:

1. **Condición de María**: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro""
2. **Hechos reales**: 
   - El perro está jugando ✓
   - Antonio NO leyó ningún libro ✗

Según la lógica de la afirmación de María:
- Como el perro SÍ está jugando, entonces Antonio DEBERÍA leer un libro
- Pero la realidad es que Antonio NO leyó ningún libro

Por lo tanto, la predicción de María resultó ser **falsa**. Lo que ella dijo que pasaría no ocurrió en la realidad."
S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Según la lógica del enunciado:

**No podemos afirmar que Antonio leyó un libro.**

Aquí está el razonamiento:

- María dijo: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro""
- Esto es una implicación: **Perro jugando → Antonio lee**
- El contexto nos dice: **El perro NO está jugando**

Cuando el antecedente de una implicación es falso (el perro no está jugando), la implicación no nos dice nada sobre la consecuencia. Antonio podría haber leído un libro o no haberlo leído; la afirmación de María simplemente no se aplica a esta situación.

En lógica proposicional:
- La afirmación de María solo nos dice qué pasará SI el perro juega
- Como el perro NO juega, no podemos concluir nada sobre si Antonio leyó o no

**Respuesta: No, no podemos afirmar que Antonio leyó un libro** basándonos en lo que dijo María y el contexto dado."
S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, no podemos afirmar que sea verdad que Ana trajo donuts.

Según lo que dijo María: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts""

El contexto confirma que:
- La nevera está vacía (se cumple la condición)

Sin embargo, María hizo una predicción condicional sobre lo que Ana **traerá** (futuro), no una afirmación sobre lo que Ana ya hizo. El hecho de que la condición (nevera vacía) se cumpla significa que, según María, Ana *debería traer* donuts, pero el contexto no nos dice explícitamente que Ana **ya los trajo**.

Para afirmar que ""Ana trajo donuts"" necesitaríamos información adicional que confirme que efectivamente lo hizo."
S9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. Ana no trajo donuts. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, **no es verdad que Ana trajo donuts**.

Según el contexto, claramente se afirma que ""Ana no trajo donuts"".

Lo que sucede es que María hizo una predicción condicional: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Dado que la nevera efectivamente está vacía, según lo que decía María, Ana **debería** haber traído donuts. Sin embargo, la realidad es que Ana no los trajo.

Por lo tanto, la predicción de María resultó ser **incorrecta**."
S9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está llena. Además, el horno está encendido. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, **no podemos afirmar que Ana trajo donuts**.

Según lo que dijo María: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts""

Esta es una proposición condicional:
- **Condición**: la nevera está vacía
- **Consecuencia**: Ana traerá donuts

Sin embargo, el contexto nos indica que **la nevera está llena** (no vacía).

Cuando la condición de un condicional es falsa, no podemos deducir nada sobre la consecuencia. Es decir:
- María solo garantizó que Ana traería donuts SI la nevera estaba vacía
- Como la nevera NO está vacía, no sabemos si Ana trajo o no trajo donuts
- Podría haberlos traído por otra razón, o podría no haberlos traído

**Conclusión**: No hay suficiente información para afirmar que Ana trajo donuts."
