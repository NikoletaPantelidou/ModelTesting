B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, it is true.

There are two reasons for this:

1.  **The provided context explicitly states it:** The very first sentence says, ""...there is pizza in the oven.""
2.  **We can deduce it from Mary's statement:** Mary makes a conditional statement (""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven""). We know the ""if"" part is true (John is hungry). For her statement to be correct, the ""then"" part must also be true."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on the context you provided, the answer is:

**No**, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven.

The context explicitly states, ""**there is no pizza in the oven**."" Mary's statement is incorrect because the condition (""John is hungry"") is true, but the result she describes (""there is pizza in the oven"") is false."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on the information given, it is **impossible to know** if there is pizza in the oven.

Here's a simple breakdown:

Mary's statement is, ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven.""

*   The condition is ""John is hungry.""
*   We know from the context that this condition is **false** (John is not hungry).

Because the ""if"" part 건물is not met, her statement tells us absolutely nothing about whether or not there is pizza in the oven. The pizza could be there, or it might not be. We lack the information to say for sure."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes.

Here's the logical breakdown:
1.  Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If Nicole's head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.""
2.  The context confirms that the ""if"" part is true: ""Nicole's head hurts.""
3.  Therefore, for Mary's statement to be logical and true, the ""then"" part must also be true."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Based on the context, **No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table.**

Here's the breakdown:

*   **The Context states the facts:** ""there is no aspirin on the table.""
*   **Mary makes a statement:** ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"".

Since we know from the context that Nicole's head does hurt, but there is no aspirin, Mary's statement is simply incorrect. The facts given in the context are the ground truth for this problem."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Based on the information provided, we cannot determine if there is aspirin on the table.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If A, then B"".
*   A = ""Nicole's head hurts""
*   B = ""There is aspirin on the table""

We know from the context that ""Nicole's head does not hurt"". This means the ""if"" part of Mary's statement (A) is false.

In logic, if the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of whether the ""then"" part is true or false. Therefore, Mary's statement is not a lie, but it gives us **no information** about whether or not there is aspirin on the table."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, **yes, it is true that there is water in the fridge.**

Here's the logic:
1.  Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""
2.  The context confirms the ""if"" part of her statement is true: ""Lucy is thirsty.""
3.  Since the ""if"" condition is met, the ""then"" part of her statement must also be true for her entire statement to be correct."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","Based on the context you provided, the answer is:

**No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge.**

The context explicitly states, ""there is no water in the fridge."" Mary's statement is incorrect."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on the information given, it is **impossible to tell**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge.""

*   The condition is ""Lucy is thirsty.""
*   The result is ""there is water in the fridge.""

The context tells us that the condition is false (Lucy is not thirsty). When the ""if"" part of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the statement doesn't tell us anything about whether the ""then"" part is true or not. There might be water in the fridge for another reason, or there might not be any at all. Mary's statement only applies to the specific situation where Lucy is thirsty."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes, it is true.

The context provides two pieces of information that confirm this:

1.  The initial context states directly: ""**there is a charger in the drawer**.""
2.  Mary's statement is ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Since the context confirms that ""Peter's phone is dead"" (the 'if' part is true), the consequence she states (""there is a charger in the drawer"") is also presented as true."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on the context provided, the answer is:

No, it is not true.

The context explicitly states, ""**there is no charger in the drawer**."" Mary's statement is incorrect."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on what Mary says, it is **unknown** whether there is a charger in the drawer.

**Here's the logical breakdown:**

Mary's statement is a conditional ""if-then"" statement: ""If [Peter's phone is dead], then [there is a charger in the drawer].""

*   The ""if"" part (the condition) is ""Peter's phone is dead."" We know from the context that this is **false**.
*   The ""then"" part (the conclusion) is ""there is a charger in the drawer.""

In logic, an ""if-then"" statement with a false condition is always considered true, regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false. Because the condition wasn't met, the statement tells us nothing about the conclusion. Mary's statement doesn't get triggered, so we can't learn anything about the drawer's contents from it."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on what Mary says, we can't be certain.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If A, then B"".
*   A = ""the weather is rainy""
*   B = ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack""

Her statement only tells you what is true *if* the condition (rainy weather) is met. Her words alone do not confirm that the condition is actually met. Therefore, based only on her statement, you cannot conclude that there is an umbrella on the coat rack."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not true.

Based on the context, what Mary says is incorrect. The context explicitly states, ""there is no umbrella on the coat rack."""
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Based on what Mary says, it is **impossible to know**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional (""If... then..."").

*   **Condition:** ""If the weather is rainy""
*   **Result:** ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack""

The context states that the weather is sunny. Since the condition (""the weather is rainy"") is not true, her statement tells us nothing about the umbrella's location. The umbrella might be there, or it might not be, but Mary's words don't confirm or deny its presence in sunny weather."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes.

Based on what Mary says, her statement is ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage.""

The context confirms that the ""if"" condition is met: ""Your tire is flat."" Therefore, the second part of her statement, ""there is a pump in the garage,"" must be true."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Based on the context, the answer is:

**No.**

The context explicitly states, ""There is no pump in the garage."" Mary's statement is incorrect."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Based on what Mary says, it is **unknown** whether there is a pump in the garage.

Here's the logical breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If X is true, then Y is true.""
*   **X:** ""Your tire is flat.""
*   **Y:** ""There is a pump in the garage.""

The context states that ""Your tire is not flat,"" meaning the ""if"" part of her statement is false. When the ""if"" part of a conditional statement is false, the statement itself doesn't tell us anything about whether the ""then"" part is true or false.

There might be a pump in the garage for other reasons, or there might not be one at all. Mary's statement only guarantees you'll find a pump if your tire is flat."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"".
2.  The context confirms that the ""if"" part of her statement is true: ""The plant is dry"".
3.  Because the condition is met, the conclusion of her statement must also be true.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on the context, **no, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.**

The context explicitly states, ""there is no water can on the shelf."" Therefore, Mary's statement is incorrect."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","It is unknown.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is an ""if-then"" condition. ""IF the plant is dry, THEN there is a water can on the shelf.""

The condition (""the plant is dry"") is false. Because the condition is not met, the statement tells us nothing about whether or not there is a water can on the shelf. The can might be there, or it might not be. We don't have enough information to know for sure."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.""
2.  The context confirms that the ""if"" part of her statement is true: ""George's shirt is wrinkled.""
3.  Because the condition is met, the conclusion of her statement must also be true.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is an iron in the closet."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on the context, here is the answer:

**No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet.**

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **The Context is Fact:** The context explicitly states, ""...there is no iron in the closet."" This is presented as the reality of the situation.
2.  **Mary's Statement is Incorrect:** Mary says, ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet."" Since we know George's shirt *is* wrinkled but there *is not* an iron in the closet, Mary's statement is false."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on what Mary says, it is **unknown** whether there is an iron in the closet.

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If A, then B.""
*   **A:** ""George's shirt is wrinkled.""
*   **B:** ""There is an iron in the closet.""

We know from the context that condition A is **false** (George's shirt is not wrinkled).

In logic, if the ""if"" part of a statement is false, the entire statement is considered true, regardless of whether the ""then"" part is true or false. Since the condition for her statement isn't met, her claim doesn't give us any information about the iron's existence."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Based on what Mary says, **yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.**

Here's the reasoning:
Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"".

1.  The context tells us that the ""if"" part is true: ""Susy wants to read"".
2.  Because the first part of her statement is true, the second part must also be true for her statement to be valid."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Based on the context you provided, the answer is:

**No.**

The context explicitly states, ""there are no books on the shelf."" Mary's statement is incorrect."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Based on what Mary says, it is **uncertain** whether there are books on the shelf.

Here's the breakdown:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If P, then Q"".

*   **P:** Susy wants to read.
*   **Q:** There are books on the shelf.

The statement only guarantees that there are books on the shelf *if* the first part is true (if Susy wants to read).

However, the context tells us that Susy **does not** want to read. Since the ""if"" condition is false, Mary's statement tells us nothing about the truth of the second part. There could be books on the shelf, or there might not be. Mary's statement is not a lie in either case."

This implies it is more used or consumed than black coffee, despite its higher price."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","No.

Based on the context, green tea is more used than black coffee. The text explicitly states that ""**most people prefer green tea**,"" which indicates higher usage or consumption despite its higher cost."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Yes, based on the context provided.

The statement, ""**many choose soda**,"" directly indicates that there is a higher demand for soda than for water in this specific situation, despite water being the healthier option."

S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Yes.

Here's why:
1.  Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"".
2.  The context confirms that the condition is true: ""The parrot is in the cage.""

Because the ""if"" part of Mary's statement is true, the ""then"" part must also be true."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No.

The context explicitly states: ""**Thomas did not bring pizza**.""

This means that Mary's statement (""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"") was incorrect. Even though the condition was met (the parrot was in the cage), the result did not happen."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on the information given, it is **impossible to know** if Thomas brought pizza.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was, ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""

*   The condition for Thomas bringing pizza (the ""if"" part) is that the parrot is in the cage.
*   We know for a fact that the parrot is **not** in the cage.

Since the condition was not met, Mary's statement tells us absolutely nothing about what happens. Thomas might have brought pizza for some other reason, or he might not have."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes, it is true.

Mary's statement created a rule: **If** you finish your broccoli, **then** Mark will give you a candy. Since you did finish your broccoli, the condition was met, and the consequence must be true."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes, it is true that Mark gave you a candy.

Here's the logic:
1.  Mary's statement was: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""
2.  The condition (""if you finish your broccoli"") was met.
3.  Therefore, according to Mary's statement, the consequence (""Mark will give you a candy"") must be true."

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on what Mary said, it is impossible to know for sure.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was a condition: **If** you finish your broccoli, **then** Mark will give you a candy.

Since you did not finish your broccoli, the condition was not met. Her statement only tells you what would happen if you *did* finish it; it says nothing about what happens if you *don't*. Mark is not obligated to give you a candy, but he still might have given you one for a different reason."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1.  **Mary's Rule:** Susan gets a camera *if* the foxes are dancing.
2.  **The Situation:** The foxes are dancing.

Since the condition in Mary's rule is true, the outcome must also be true."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes.

Here's the reasoning:
1.  Mary's statement creates a rule: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera.""
2.  The context confirms that the ""if"" part of the rule is true: ""The foxes are dancing.""
3.  Therefore, the ""then"" part of the rule must also be true: Susan got a camera."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","It is unknown.

Here's why:

Mary's statement only guarantees that Susan gets a camera *if* the foxes are dancing. Since the foxes are **not** dancing, the condition isn't met. The statement tells us nothing about what happens if the foxes are not dancing. Susan might have gotten a camera for another reason, or she might not have. We don't have enough information to know for sure."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes.

Here's the reasoning:
Mary's statement is a conditional rule: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""

1.  The condition is ""the TV is on"".
2.  The context states that the TV is indeed on.

Since the condition is met, the outcome must be true. Therefore, Matthew baked cookies. (The fact that the radio is also on is extra information that doesn't change the outcome)."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on the context, here is the answer:

No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.

The context explicitly states, ""Matthew did not bake cookies."" This means that what Mary said (""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"") turned out to be incorrect."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on what Mary said, it is **unknown** whether Matthew baked cookies.

Here's why:

Mary's statement only tells us what happens if a specific condition is met: ""If the TV is on...""

Since the TV is off, the condition was not met. Therefore, Mary's statement doesn't give us any information about what Matthew did or didn't do. He might have baked cookies for another reason, or he might not have baked them at all."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Yes.

According to Mary's statement, if the condition ""the weather is sunny"" is true, then the outcome ""Emma will wear purple"" must also be true. Since the context confirms that the weather is sunny today, it is true that Emma wore purple."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on the context, here is the answer:

No, it is not true that Emma wore purple. The context explicitly states that ""Emma is wearing green.""

This means that what Mary said (""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"") was incorrect."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Based on the information given, the answer is: **Unknown.**

Here's why:

Mary's statement only tells us what Emma would do **if** the weather were sunny. Since the weather is rainy, the condition of her statement isn't met. Therefore, we have no information about what color Emma is wearing."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Yes, it is true.

Here's why:
*   **Mary's rule is:** ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"".
*   **The context states:** ""The playground is empty.""

Since the condition stated in Mary's rule has been met, the consequence must be true."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on the context, here is the answer:

**No**, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.

The context explicitly states, ""Angela did not take a selfie."" This means that what Mary said would happen (""Angela will take a selfie"") turned out to be incorrect."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on the information provided, the answer is: **We don't know.**

Here's why:

*   Mary's statement was a condition: Angela would take a selfie **if** the playground was empty.
*   The context states that the playground is **crowded**.
*   Since the condition (an empty playground) was not met, we have no information about what Angela did or didn't do."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based on the information given, the answer is: **It's not possible to know for sure.**

Here's why:

Mary's promise was conditional: Paul gets the money **if** he is the one who mows the lawn. We know the lawn was mowed, but we don't know **who** mowed it.

*   **If Paul mowed the lawn**, then yes, he got 50 euros.
*   **If someone else mowed the lawn**, then no, Paul did not get the 50 euros."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based on the context provided, the answer is:

**No.**

The context explicitly states, ""Paul did not get 50 euros."""
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No.

Paul only gets the 50 euros **if** he mows the lawn. The context states that the lawn has not been mowed, so he did not fulfill the condition to get the money."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Yes, it is true that Anthony read a book.

Here's why:
1.  Mary's rule is: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"".
2.  The context states: ""The dog is playing"".

Since the condition of Mary's statement (the dog playing) is true, the result (Anthony reading a book) must also be true."
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not true that Anthony read a book.

The context explicitly states, ""Anthony did not read a book."" This means that what Mary said (""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"") turned out to be incorrect."
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Based on the information provided, the answer is **Uncertain**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book,"" only tells us what happens when the dog is playing.

Since the dog is **not** playing, the condition is not met. Her statement gives us no information about what Anthony will do in this situation. He might have read a book for another reason, or he might not have."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Based on what Mary says, yes, it is true that Amy brought donuts.

Here's the logical breakdown:
1.  Mary's statement is a conditional rule: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""
2.  The context confirms that the condition is met: ""The fridge is empty.""
3.  Therefore, according to Mary's rule, the consequence must be true: Amy brought donuts.

(The fact that the oven is broken is extra information that doesn't affect the outcome of Mary's statement.)"
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No.

The context explicitly states, ""**Amy did not bring donuts**.""

This means that Mary's statement (""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"") was incorrect."
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","The answer is **undetermined**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement was, ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts.""

The condition for Amy bringing donuts (according to Mary) is an empty fridge. Since the fridge is full, the condition was not met. Therefore, Mary's statement tells us nothing about what happens when the fridge is full. Amy might have brought donuts, or she might not have. We can't know from the information given."
B1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i hi ha pizza al forn. També hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No, basant-nos **només en el que diu la Maria**, no podem estar segurs que hi hagi pizza al forn.

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional (""Si... llavors...""). Ella no diu ""Hi ha pizza al forn"". El que diu és que la presència de la pizza està condicionada al fet que en Joan tingui gana.

Per tant, la seva frase per si sola no confirma que la pizza existeixi, només estableix una regla."
B1F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i no hi ha pizza al forn. Tampoc no hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Sí.

**Explicació:**

Segons la lògica del que diu la Maria (""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn""), i sabent que la primera part (""en Joan té gana"") és certa, la conclusió del seu raonament és que la segona part (""hi ha pizza al forn"") també ha de ser certa.

Això no canvia el fet que, en realitat, el context ens diu que no hi ha pizza. Simplement, vol dir que **el que diu la Maria no és veritat**."
B1C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan no té gana. Hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No, no podem saber si és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn.

**Explicació:**

L'afirmació de la Maria és una condició: **si** passa una cosa (que en Joan tingui gana), **llavors** en passa una altra (hi ha pizza al forn).

Com que sabem que en Joan **no té gana**, la condició inicial no es compleix. Per tant, la frase de la Maria no ens obliga a concloure res sobre l'existència de la pizza. Podria haver-hi pizza al forn o podria no haver-n'hi; en ambdós casos, el que diu la Maria no és mentida.

En resum: amb la informació que tenim, és **indeterminat**."
B2T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria té mal de cap i hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","Sí.

Segons la lògica del que diu la Maria (""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""), i sabent que la primera part de la frase (""la Núria té mal de cap"") és certa, la segona part (""hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"") també ha de ser-ho."

El context diu explícitament que **""no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""**.

Per tant, el que diu la Maria és una afirmació incorrecta o falsa."
B2C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Núria no té mal de cap. També hi ha ibuprofèn al calaix. La Maria diu: ""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aspirines sobre la taula?","No, **no ho podem saber**.

**Explicació:**

El que diu la Maria és una frase condicional: ""**Si** la Núria té mal de cap (la condició), **llavors** hi ha aspirines sobre la taula (la conseqüència)"".

Sabem pel context que la condició és **falsa** (la Núria **no** té mal de cap).

En lògica, quan la primera part d'una afirmació (""si..."") és falsa, la frase sencera és tècnicament vàlida, però no ens diu absolutament res sobre si la segona part (""llavors..."") és certa o no.

Per tant, basant-nos només en la informació que tenim, és impossible determinar si hi ha aspirines sobre la taula. Podria haver-n'hi o podria no haver-n'hi."
B3T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia té set i hi ha aigua a la nevera. També hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","Sí.

Segons la lògica de la frase de la Maria (""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua a la nevera""), com que sabem que la primera part (""la Llúcia té set"") és veritat, la segona part (""hi ha aigua a la nevera"") també ha de ser-ho."
B3F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia té set i no hi ha aigua a la nevera. Tampoc no hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No.

El context diu explícitament que ""no hi ha aigua a la nevera"". Per tant, l'afirmació de la Maria és incorrecta."
B3C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia no té set. Hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera?","No ho podem saber.

**Explicació:**

L'afirmació de la Maria és una condició: ""Si la Llúcia té set, (llavors) hi ha aigua a la nevera"".

Això només ens assegura que hi ha aigua si la condició (que la Llúcia tingui set) es compleix. Però el context ens diu just el contrari: **""La Llúcia no té set""**.

Com que la condició no es compleix, l'afirmació de la Maria no ens diu res sobre si hi ha aigua a la nevera o no. Podria haver-n'hi o podria no haver-n'hi."
B4T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria i hi ha un carregador al calaix. També hi ha un ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","No necessàriament.

Basant-nos només en el que diu la Maria, no podem afirmar que sigui veritat. La seva frase és una **condició**: ella només garanteix que hi ha un carregador al calaix **si es compleix** que el mòbil del Pere no tingui bateria.

La seva afirmació, per si sola, no confirma l'existència del carregador, sinó la relació entre les dues situacions."

La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","No, no és veritat.

El context inicial diu explícitament que ""**no hi ha cap carregador al calaix**"".

El que diu la Maria (""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"") és una afirmació que, segons el context, és falsa, perquè la primera part és certa (el mòbil no té bateria) però la segona és falsa (no hi ha carregador)."
B4C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere està carregat. Hi ha un ordinador sobre la taula. La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","No ho podem saber.

El que diu la Maria és una afirmació condicional: només assegura que hi ha un carregador si es compleix la condició que el mòbil no tingui bateria.

Com que el mòbil del Pere **sí que està carregat**, la condició no es compleix. Per tant, la seva frase no ens diu res sobre si finalment hi ha un carregador al calaix o no. Podria ser que hi fos, o podria ser que no."
B5T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El temps és plujós i hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer. També hi ha un impermeable al cotxe. La Maria diu: ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer?","Sí, és veritat.

El context que has proporcionat ho afirma de dues maneres:

1.  **Directament:** La primera frase del context diu explícitament que ""hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"".
2.  **Per deducció:** La Maria diu ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Com que el context també confirma que ""el temps és plujós"", la condició es compleix i, per tant, la conseqüència que ella esmenta també és certa."

Segons el context que has proporcionat, és fals. El text diu explícitament: ""**no hi ha cap paraigua al paraigüer**"".

**Explicació:**

La Maria fa una afirmació condicional: ""Si la roda està punxada (condició), llavors hi ha un inflador al garatge (conseqüència)"".

Segons la lògica de la frase de la Maria (""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria""), i com que el context ens confirma que la planta està seca, la seva afirmació implica que la conseqüència ha de ser certa.

En altres paraules, com que la condició (""la planta està seca"") es compleix, la conseqüència (""hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria"") també ha de ser veritat segons el seu raonament."

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","In base *solo e unicamente* a quello che dice Maria, non possiamo esserne certi.

**Spiegazione:**
La frase di Maria (""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"") è un'affermazione condizionale. Non afferma che la pizza c'è in assoluto, ma solo che c'è **a condizione che** Gianni abbia fame.

Per poter concludere, seguendo la logica di Maria, che c'è la pizza, dobbiamo sapere che la prima parte della sua frase (""Gianni ha fame"") è vera.

Dato che il contesto ci dice che Gianni ha effettivamente fame, possiamo usare la sua affermazione per concludere che, sì, c'è della pizza in forno."

Il contesto iniziale afferma chiaramente che **""non c'è della pizza in forno""**.

Quello che dice Maria (""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"") è un'affermazione che, basandosi sui fatti, risulta essere **falsa**. Dato che la premessa (""Gianni ha fame"") è vera, ma la conseguenza (""c'è della pizza in forno"") è falsa, l'intera frase di Maria è scorretta."
B1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni non ha fame. C'è della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non possiamo saperlo con certezza.**

Ecco la spiegazione:

La frase di Maria è un'ipotesi (""**Se** Gianni ha fame...""). Ci dice cosa succede a una specifica condizione.

*   La **condizione** è: ""Gianni ha fame"".
*   La **conseguenza** è: ""c'è della pizza in forno"".

Dal momento che il contesto ci dice che Gianni **non ha fame**, la condizione non si verifica. Di conseguenza, la frase di Maria non ci dà nessuna informazione sulla presenza o meno della pizza.

*   Potrebbe esserci della pizza in forno.
*   Potrebbe non esserci.

Entrambe le situazioni sono compatibili con quello che ha detto Maria."

**Spiegazione:**

L'affermazione di Maria è una frase condizionale (""Se... allora..."").

1.  La condizione è: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa"". Il contesto ci dice che questa condizione è **vera**.
2.  La conseguenza è: ""ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"".

Poiché la condizione iniziale (""Nicoletta ha mal di testa"") è vera, anche la conseguenza che ne deriva deve essere vera affinché la frase di Maria abbia senso."

Il contesto afferma chiaramente che ""**non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo**"".

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"") è **falsa**, perché la premessa (Nicoletta ha mal di testa) è vera, ma la conclusione (ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo) è falsa. In parole semplici, Maria si sbaglia."

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è un'ipotesi del tipo ""Se A, allora B"":
*   **A:** Nicoletta ha mal di testa.
*   **B:** Ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo.

La frase ci dice cosa succede **solo se** la condizione A è vera.

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione logica del tipo ""SE A, ALLORA B"":
*   **A (la condizione):** ""Lucia ha sete""
*   **B (la conseguenza):** ""c'è dell'acqua in frigo""

Il contesto ci informa che la condizione A (""Lucia ha sete"") è vera. Poiché l'affermazione di Maria è data come valida e la sua condizione è soddisfatta, anche la conseguenza B (""c'è dell'acqua in frigo"") deve essere vera."
B3F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e non c'è dell'acqua in frigo. Non c'è nemmeno del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","No, non è vero.

Il contesto iniziale afferma chiaramente che **""non c'è dell'acqua in frigo""**.

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"") è **falsa**, perché la premessa (""Lucia ha sete"") è vera, ma la conseguenza (""c'è dell'acqua in frigo"") è falsa. In poche parole, Maria si sbaglia."
B3C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia non ha sete. C'è del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non possiamo saperlo con certezza.**

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione del tipo ""SE A, ALLORA B"":
*   **A (la condizione):** ""Lucia ha sete""
*   **B (la conseguenza):** ""C'è dell'acqua in frigo""

Noi sappiamo dal contesto che la condizione A (""Lucia ha sete"") è **falsa**.

In logica, quando la condizione di un'implicazione è falsa, l'intera frase è considerata vera, **a prescindere dal fatto che la conseguenza sia vera o falsa**.

Questo significa che entrambe le seguenti situazioni sono compatibili con la frase di Maria:
1.  Lucia non ha sete e c'è dell'acqua in frigo.
2.  Lucia non ha sete e non c'è dell'acqua in frigo.

Poiché la frase di Maria è valida in entrambi i casi, non possiamo usarla per concludere se l'acqua ci sia o meno."
B4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. C'è anche un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","Sì, è vero.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è una proposizione condizionale: ""Se [condizione], allora [conseguenza]"".

*   **Condizione:** ""Il telefono di Pietro è scarico""
*   **Conseguenza:** ""C'è un caricatore nel cassetto""

Dal contesto, sappiamo che la condizione (""Il telefono di Pietro è scarico"") è vera. Affinché l'intera affermazione di Maria sia vera, anche la conseguenza deve essere vera.

Quindi, basandoci su ciò che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto."
B4F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. Non c'è nemmeno un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","No, non è vero.

Il contesto afferma esplicitamente: ""**non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto**"".

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"") è falsa, perché la premessa (""il telefono è scarico"") è vera, ma la conseguenza che lei enuncia (""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"") è smentita dai fatti del contesto."
B4C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è carico. C'è un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non è possibile saperlo**.

Ecco perché:

La frase di Maria è un'ipotesi: ""SE il telefono è scarico, ALLORA c'è un caricatore"".

*   La condizione (""il telefono è scarico"") è **falsa**, perché sappiamo dal contesto che il telefono è carico.
*   Dato che la condizione non si è verificata, la frase di Maria non ci dà nessuna informazione su cosa succede nell'altro caso (cioè quando il telefono è carico).

Il caricatore potrebbe esserci, come potrebbe non esserci. Le parole di Maria non ci permettono di stabilirlo."
B5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. C'è anche un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non è possibile saperlo con certezza.**

La sua è un'affermazione condizionale (""se... allora...""). Dice solo che *se* il tempo è piovoso, *allora* c'è un ombrello. La sua frase, da sola, non conferma che ci sia effettivamente un ombrello, ma stabilisce solo una relazione tra due eventi.

Per poter concludere che c'è un ombrello basandoci sulle sue parole, dovremmo prima confermare che la condizione (il tempo piovoso) sia vera."
B5F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. Non c'è nemmeno un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No.

Il contesto afferma chiaramente che ""non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"".

L'affermazione di Maria è in contraddizione con la realtà descritta dal contesto, quindi quello che dice Maria è falso."
B5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è sereno. C'è un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","In base a quello che dice Maria, **non è possibile saperlo con certezza**.

Ecco la spiegazione:
Maria stabilisce una condizione: **SE** il tempo è piovoso, **ALLORA** c'è un ombrello.

Dato che il tempo è sereno, la condizione non è soddisfatta. La sua frase non ci dà alcuna informazione su cosa succede quando non piove. L'ombrello potrebbe esserci, come potrebbe anche non esserci."
B6T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e c'è una pompa in garage. C'è anche una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","Sì, è vero.

**Ecco la spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione logica del tipo ""Se A, allora B"":
*   **A (la condizione):** ""la gomma della macchina è a terra""
*   **B (la conseguenza):** ""c'è una pompa in garage""

Il contesto ci dice che la condizione A è vera (la gomma è effettivamente a terra). Affinché l'intera affermazione di Maria sia corretta, anche la conseguenza B deve essere vera.

In altre parole, dato che la premessa del suo discorso è confermata, anche la conclusione deve essere vera."
B6F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e non c'è nessuna pompa in garage. Non c'è nemmeno una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No, non è vero.

Il contesto iniziale stabilisce chiaramente che ""**non c'è nessuna pompa in garage**"".

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"") è un'ipotesi che si rivela **falsa**, perché la condizione (la gomma è a terra) è vera, ma la conseguenza (c'è una pompa in garage) è falsa.

In sintesi, Maria si sbaglia."
B6C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è gonfia. C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","Non possiamo saperlo con certezza.

**Spiegazione:**

L'affermazione di Maria è una frase condizionale (""Se..., allora...""). Lei ci dice dove si trova la pompa **solo a condizione che** la gomma sia a terra.

Dato che il contesto ci dice che la gomma è gonfia, la condizione non è soddisfatta. Di conseguenza, la frase di Maria non ci dà alcuna informazione sulla presenza o meno della pompa in garage in questa situazione. Potrebbe esserci, come no."
B7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. C'è anche un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","Sì, è vero.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione logica: ""Se si verifica la condizione A (la pianta è secca), allora si verifica la conseguenza B (c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale)"".

Dato che il contesto ci conferma che la condizione A (""La pianta è secca"") è vera, la frase di Maria ci porta a concludere che anche la conseguenza B (""c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"") deve essere vera."
B7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No.

Quello che dice Maria è un'affermazione che, basandosi sul contesto, è **falsa**.

Il contesto stabilisce due fatti:
1. La pianta è secca (Vero).
2. Non c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale (Vero).

L'affermazione di Maria (""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"") risulta quindi falsa, perché la premessa è vera ma la conseguenza è falsa. Di conseguenza, non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale."
B7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è rigogliosa. C'è un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","Non è possibile saperlo.

**Spiegazione:**

L'affermazione di Maria è una condizione: ""**Se** la pianta è secca, **allora** c'è un annaffiatoio"".

Dal contesto sappiamo che la pianta è rigogliosa, quindi la condizione ""la pianta è secca"" è **falsa**.

Quando la premessa di un'affermazione ""se... allora"" è falsa, l'affermazione non ci dà alcuna informazione sulla veridicità della seconda parte. L'annaffiatoio potrebbe esserci, come potrebbe non esserci. La frase di Maria non si applica a questa situazione."
B8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. C'è anche un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","Sì, è vero.

Il contesto iniziale stabilisce chiaramente che **""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio""**.

L'affermazione di Maria è corretta perché collega due fatti entrambi veri: la premessa (""la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata"") e la conseguenza (""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"")."
B8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non c'è nemmeno un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No.

Il contesto afferma esplicitamente che ""**non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio**"".

L'affermazione di Maria è una frase condizionale (""Se... allora...""). Poiché sappiamo che la premessa (""la camicia è stropicciata"") è vera, ma la conseguenza (""c'è un ferro da stiro"") è falsa, si può concludere che l'intera frase di Maria è falsa."
B8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stirata. C'è un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","**Non è possibile saperlo.**

Ecco la spiegazione logica:

L'affermazione di Maria è una frase ipotetica del tipo ""Se A, allora B"".

*   **A (la condizione):** ""la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata""
*   **B (la conseguenza):** ""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio""

Dal contesto sappiamo che la camicia di Giorgio **è stirata**, quindi la condizione A è **falsa**.

Quando in una frase ipotetica la condizione è falsa, non possiamo dedurre assolutamente nulla sulla conseguenza. La frase di Maria ci dice cosa succede *solo nel caso in cui* la camicia fosse stropicciata, ma non ci dà nessuna informazione sulla situazione attuale (visto che la camicia è stirata).

In breve: il ferro da stiro potrebbe esserci, come potrebbe non esserci. Non abbiamo abbastanza informazioni per dirlo con certezza."

Anche se la frase di Maria ha la forma di un'ipotesi (""Se...""), nel linguaggio comune questa costruzione viene usata per dare un'informazione certa e pertinente a una specifica condizione.

In altre parole, Maria non sta mettendo in dubbio l'esistenza dei libri. Sta affermando che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale come soluzione al fatto che Susanna vuole leggere."
B9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e non ci sono libri sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","No.

S7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","Non è possibile saperlo con certezza.

Il contesto ci dice che il prato è stato tagliato, ma non specifica **chi** lo ha tagliato. La condizione di Maria era che **Paolo** tagliasse il prato per ricevere i 50 euro.

Se il prato è stato tagliato da Paolo, allora ha ricevuto i soldi. Ma se l'ha tagliato qualcun altro, non li ha ricevuti. Poiché non abbiamo questa informazione, non possiamo dare una risposta sicura."
S7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","No.

Il testo afferma esplicitamente: ""**Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro**"".

Anche se il prato è stato tagliato, il fatto che Paolo non abbia ricevuto i soldi (nonostante la promessa di Maria) implica che non sia stato lui a compiere l'azione."
S7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato non è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori devono ancora essere annaffiati.  Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","No.

La promessa di Maria era condizionale: Paolo avrebbe ricevuto i 50 euro **solo se** avesse tagliato il prato. Poiché il contesto afferma che ""il prato non è stato tagliato"", la condizione non si è verificata e di conseguenza Paolo non ha ricevuto i soldi."
S8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","Sì.

**Spiegazione:**
Maria ha stabilito una condizione: ""**Se** il cane sta giocando, **allora** Antonio leggerà un libro"".

Dato che il contesto conferma che la condizione è vera (""Il cane sta giocando""), di conseguenza, secondo la logica di Maria, è vero che Antonio leggerà un libro."
S8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Antonio non ha letto nessun libro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","In base alla logica di quello che dice Maria, **sì**.

Ecco perché:
1.  **La regola di Maria è:** ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"".
2.  **La condizione si è verificata:** Il contesto ci dice che ""Il cane sta giocando"".

Dato che la prima parte della frase di Maria (la condizione) è vera, secondo la sua logica dovrebbe esserlo anche la seconda parte (la conseguenza).

**Tuttavia**, il contesto generale ci dice anche che ""Antonio non ha letto nessun libro"". Questo significa che l'affermazione di Maria si è rivelata **falsa** nella realtà."
S8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane non sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto sta dormendo. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","In base alle informazioni fornite, **non è possibile saperlo**.

Ecco la spiegazione:

La frase di Maria è un'implicazione logica: ""SE il cane sta giocando, ALLORA Antonio leggerà un libro"".

1.  La condizione per cui Antonio legge un libro è che **il cane stia giocando**.
2.  Il contesto ci dice chiaramente che ""**il cane non sta giocando**"".

Dato che la condizione non si è verificata, la frase di Maria non ci dà alcuna informazione su quello che farà Antonio. Antonio potrebbe leggere un libro per altri motivi, oppure potrebbe non leggerlo affatto. Non abbiamo abbastanza dati per trarre una conclusione."
S9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","Sì, in base a quanto detto da Maria, **è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle.**

La logica è la seguente:

1.  **La condizione posta da Maria è:** ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto...""
2.  **Il contesto conferma che la condizione è vera:** ""Il frigorifero è vuoto.""
3.  **La conseguenza della condizione è:** ""...Anna porterà delle ciambelle.""

Dato che la condizione si è verificata, secondo la logica della frase di Maria, anche la conseguenza deve essere vera."
S9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","In base a quello che dice Maria, Anna avrebbe dovuto portare le ciambelle, perché la condizione (il frigorifero vuoto) si è verificata.

Tuttavia, il contesto afferma esplicitamente il contrario: ""**Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle**"".

Quindi, la risposta è: **No, non è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle.** Ciò significa che l'affermazione di Maria si è rivelata falsa."
S9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è pieno. Inoltre, il forno è acceso. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è possibile determinarlo con certezza.

**Spiegazione:**

La frase di Maria è un'ipotesi: ""SE il frigorifero è vuoto, ALLORA Anna porterà delle ciambelle"".

1.  **La condizione:** che il frigorifero sia vuoto.
2.  **Il contesto:** ci dice che ""il frigorifero è pieno"".

Dato che la condizione non si è verificata, la frase di Maria non ci dà nessuna informazione su quello che ha fatto Anna. Anna potrebbe aver portato le ciambelle per un altro motivo, oppure non averle portate affatto. Non possiamo saperlo."
B1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y hay pizza en el horno. También hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No, no se puede saber con certeza **solo basándose en la frase de María**.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María (""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"") es una **afirmación condicional**. Esto significa que solo nos asegura que hay pizza si la condición (que Juan tenga hambre) se cumple.

*   Si Juan **sí** tiene hambre, entonces su afirmación nos dice que **sí** hay pizza.
*   Si Juan **no** tuviera hambre, su afirmación no nos dice nada sobre la pizza. Podría haberla o no.

Por lo tanto, la frase de María por sí sola no es suficiente para confirmar que hay pizza. Necesitas saber también si Juan tiene hambre para poder sacar una conclusión."
B1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y no hay pizza en el horno. Tampoco hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No, no es verdad que hay pizza en el horno.

El propio contexto inicial afirma que ""**no hay pizza en el horno**"". Lo que dice María es una afirmación incorrecta, ya que la condición que ella pone (que Juan tenga hambre) sí se cumple, pero la consecuencia (que haya pizza) no es cierta."
B1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan no tiene hambre. Hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No se puede saber con certeza.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es un **condicional**: ""Si [pasa A], entonces [pasa B]"".

*   **A (la condición):** ""Juan tiene hambre"".
*   **B (la consecuencia):** ""Hay pizza en el horno"".

Sabemos por el contexto que la condición (A) es **falsa** (Juan no tiene hambre). Cuando la condición de una frase ""si... entonces..."" es falsa, la frase no nos da ninguna información sobre si la consecuencia es verdadera o no.

En resumen, lo que María dice no se contradice si no hay pizza, y tampoco se contradice si sí la hay. Simplemente, su afirmación no nos permite saberlo."
B2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","Sí.

El enunciado de María es una afirmación condicional: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, (entonces) hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"".

Dado que el contexto confirma que la primera parte de su afirmación (""a Noelia le duele la cabeza"") es verdad, la segunda parte (""hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"") también se cumple según su lógica."
B2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no es verdad.

El propio contexto afirma claramente que ""**no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa**"".

Lo que dice María es una afirmación **falsa**, porque se cumple la condición (a Noelia le duele la cabeza) pero no se cumple el resultado (no hay aspirinas)."
B2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condición: ""Si [pasa A], entonces [pasa B]"".

*   **A:** A Noelia le duele la cabeza.
*   **B:** Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Según el contexto, sabemos que la condición A (""A Noelia le duele la cabeza"") es **falsa**.

Cuando la primera parte de una condición ""Si... entonces..."" es falsa, la frase entera es lógicamente válida, pero **no nos da ninguna información sobre la segunda parte**. La existencia de aspirinas solo estaba garantizada si a Noelia le dolía la cabeza, pero como no le duele, no podemos afirmar ni negar que haya aspirinas en la mesa."
B3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y hay agua en la nevera. También hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","No, no se puede saber con certeza **solo a partir de la frase de María**.

La frase de María es una condición: ""SI Lucía tiene sed, ENTONCES hay agua en la nevera"".

Esto no afirma que haya agua en la nevera en todo momento, solo afirma que la hay si se cumple la primera parte (que Lucía tenga sed).

Sin embargo, como el contexto nos dice que **Lucía sí tiene sed**, podemos aplicar la condición de María y concluir que, según su lógica, sí hay agua en la nevera."
B3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. Tampoco hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","No, no es verdad.

Lo que dice María es una frase condicional (""Si... entonces...""). Ella no afirma que ""hay agua en la nevera"" como un hecho, sino como una consecuencia de que Lucía tenga sed.

Dado que el contexto nos dice claramente que **""no hay agua en la nevera""**, la segunda parte de la afirmación de María es falsa."
B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, según la lógica de la frase de María, es verdad.

María establece una condición: si Lucía tiene sed (condición), entonces hay agua en la nevera (consecuencia).

Como el contexto confirma que la condición (Lucía tiene sed) se cumple, entonces la consecuencia (hay agua en la nevera) también debe ser cierta."
B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa.

1.  **La condición:** ""el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería"".
2.  **La consecuencia:** ""hay un cargador en el cajón"".

Según el contexto, la condición se cumple (el móvil de Pedro efectivamente se ha quedado sin batería). Por lo tanto, según la lógica de la afirmación de María, la consecuencia también debe ser cierta."

El propio contexto inicial lo deja claro al afirmar: ""**no hay ningún cargador en el cajón**"".

La frase de María es una afirmación que resulta ser **falsa**, porque aunque la primera parte es cierta (el móvil sí se ha quedado sin batería), la segunda parte (hay un cargador en el cajón) es mentira según el contexto."
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condición: ""**Si** el móvil se queda sin batería, **entonces** hay un cargador"".

1.  La condición para que su afirmación nos dé información es que ""el móvil de Pedro se haya quedado sin batería"".
2.  Sabemos por el contexto que esa condición **no se cumple**, porque el móvil tiene la batería llena.

Según lo que dice María, si está lloviendo *debería* haber un paraguas. Sin embargo, el contexto inicial deja claro que **no hay ninguno**.

Lo que dice María es una frase condicional. Ella solo afirma que habrá un paraguas **si** llueve.

La afirmación de María es una frase condicional: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada (condición), entonces hay una bomba de aire en el garaje (consecuencia)"".

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una **condición** (""Si..., entonces..."").

*   **Condición:** Si la rueda está pinchada.
*   **Consecuencia:** Hay una bomba en el garaje.

Como la rueda **no está pinchada** (está inflada), la condición no se cumple. Por lo tanto, la frase de María no nos da ninguna información sobre si realmente hay una bomba en el garaje o no. Podría haberla, o podría no haberla."

María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","Sí.

El razonamiento es el siguiente:

1.  **María establece una condición:** ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada...""
2.  **El contexto confirma que esa condición se cumple:** La camisa de Jorge está arrugada.

Lo que María dice es una afirmación falsa, porque aunque la primera parte es cierta (la camisa está arrugada), la segunda parte (hay una plancha en el armario) es falsa."

En lógica, cuando la primera parte de una afirmación ""si... entonces..."" es falsa, la afirmación completa es verdadera, **sin importar si la segunda parte es verdadera o falsa**.

B9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y hay libros en la estantería. También hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No, no se puede saber con total seguridad **solo por la frase de María**.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es un condicional: ""Si A, entonces B"".

*   **A:** Susana quiere leer.
*   **B:** Hay libros en la estantería.

Esta frase no afirma que haya libros en la estantería. Solo establece una condición: en el caso de que Susana quiera leer, entonces habrá libros. La frase podría ser cierta incluso si no hubiera libros, siempre y cuando Susana no quisiera leer.

Sin embargo, si combinamos la frase de María con el resto del contexto (que nos dice que ""Susana quiere leer""), entonces la conclusión lógica es que **sí, es verdad que hay libros en la estantería.**"

*   **La condición (A):** ""Susana quiere leer"".

El contexto nos dice que la condición (A) es **falsa** (Susana no quiere leer).

La razón es que se cumplen las dos partes del argumento:
1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza"".
2.  **El hecho:** ""El loro está en la jaula"".

Como la condición se ha cumplido, la consecuencia (que Tomás trajo pizza) es cierta, según la lógica de lo que dijo María."
S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No.

Según lo que decía María, si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás *debería haber traído* pizza. Sin embargo, el contexto deja claro que **Tomás no trajo pizza.**

Esto significa que la afirmación de María resultó ser falsa."
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no se puede saber si Tomás trajo pizza.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condición: **Si** el loro está en la jaula, **entonces** Tomás traerá pizza.

Como el contexto dice que ""el loro **no** está en la jaula"", la condición inicial no se cumple. Por lo tanto, la frase de María no nos dice nada sobre lo que hizo Tomás. Pudo haber traído pizza o no, pero no podemos saberlo con la información que tenemos."
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Sí.

Según la lógica de lo que dijo María, al haberte comido el brócoli (que era la condición), la consecuencia es que Marcos te dio un caramelo."
S2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. Marcos no te dio un caramelo. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No, no es verdad.

El contexto dice explícitamente: ""**Marcos no te dio un caramelo**"".

Lo que dijo María (""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"") resultó ser falso, porque aunque cumpliste la condición (comerte el brócoli), la consecuencia (recibir el caramelo) no sucedió."
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No se puede saber con la información que se da.

**Explicación:**
La condición para que Marcos te diera un caramelo era que te comieras el brócoli. Como no te lo comiste, la promesa de María no se aplica. Esto no significa que Marcos no te diera el caramelo, podría habértelo dado por otra razón, pero tampoco podemos asegurar que sí lo hiciera."
S3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","Según lo que decía María, no es posible saber si Susana recibió una cámara.

La frase dice que si los zorros bailan, **Irene** recibirá una cámara. No se menciona a Susana en ningún momento."
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?","No, no es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara.

El propio contexto lo dice explícitamente: ""**Irene no recibió una cámara**"".

Además, lo que María dijo se refería a Susana, no a Irene: ""Si los zorros están bailando, **Susana** recibirá una cámara""."
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","Es imposible saberlo.

El contexto no menciona a ninguna persona llamada Susana. La frase de María se refiere a que **Irene** recibiría una cámara."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí, es verdad.

La condición que puso María fue: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"".

El contexto confirma que la televisión está encendida, por lo tanto, según la lógica de lo que dijo María, Mateo hizo galletas. El hecho de que la radio también esté encendida es un dato extra que no afecta a esta conclusión."
S4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. Mateo no hizo galletas. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí.

Según la lógica de lo que dijo María (""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"") y sabiendo que la televisión está encendida, la conclusión es que Mateo hizo galletas.

(Esto nos demuestra que lo que María dijo era, en realidad, falso, porque el contexto aclara que Mateo no las hizo)."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No se puede saber.

**Explicación:**

La frase de María es una condición: ""**Si** la televisión está encendida,...""

Como la televisión está apagada, la condición no se cumple. Por lo tanto, no tenemos ninguna información sobre si Mateo hizo galletas o no. Él podría haberlas hecho o no, y en ninguno de los dos casos se contradiría lo que dijo María."
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Sí, según lo que dijo María, es verdad.

La lógica es la siguiente:
1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".
2.  **La realidad:** El tiempo está soleado.

Como la condición se cumple, la consecuencia que María predijo (que Emma iría de morado) también se debe cumplir."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, no es verdad.

El contexto dice claramente que **Emma fue de verde**.

La predicción de María (""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"") no se cumplió, porque aunque el tiempo sí estaba soleado, Emma fue de verde."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No se puede saber.

La condición que puso María para que Emma fuera de morado era que el tiempo estuviera **soleado**. Como el tiempo está lluvioso, la condición no se cumple, por lo que no tenemos ninguna información sobre el color de la ropa de Emma."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí, según lo que dijo María, es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie.

La razón es que se cumple la condición que María estableció:

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"".
2.  **El contexto:** Confirma que ""el parque infantil está vacío"".

Por lo tanto, al cumplirse la condición, la consecuencia es que Júlia se hizo un selfie."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí.

Según la afirmación de María (""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie""), es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie, porque la condición (el parque estaba vacío) se cumplió.

No obstante, es importante señalar que la afirmación de María resultó ser falsa, ya que el contexto deja claro que, en realidad, Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No, no podemos saber si es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie.

**Explicación:**
La condición que puso María para que Júlia se hiciera un selfie era que **""el parque infantil estuviera vacío""**.

Según el contexto, **el parque infantil está lleno**. Por lo tanto, la condición no se cumplió. Lo que dijo María solo nos informa de lo que pasaría si el parque estuviera vacío, pero no dice nada sobre lo que ocurriría si estuviera lleno."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No se puede saber con certeza.

El contexto nos dice que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero **no especifica quién lo cortó**.

La condición de María era que *si Pablo cortaba el césped*, él recibiría el dinero. Como no sabemos si fue Pablo quien lo hizo, no podemos confirmar si recibió los 50 euros."

**Explicación:**

El contexto dice que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero no especifica **quién** lo cortó.

La condición que puso María era que **si Pablo** cortaba el césped, recibiría el dinero. Como no sabemos si fue Pablo o cualquier otra persona quien lo cortó, no podemos afirmar que haya recibido los 50 euros."
S7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped no ha sido cortado. Además, las flores no han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No, no es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros.

**Explicación:**
María estableció una condición: Pablo recibiría el dinero **si** cortaba el césped. Como el césped no fue cortado, Pablo no cumplió la condición y, por lo tanto, no recibió los 50 euros."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Sí, es verdad.

La frase de María es una condición: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"".

Como el contexto confirma que **el perro está jugando**, la condición se cumple, y por lo tanto, la consecuencia (que Antonio leerá un libro) también es verdadera."
S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Según la lógica de lo que dijo María, **sí, es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro**.

**Explicación:**

1.  **La condición de María:** ""Si el perro está jugando...""
2.  **El hecho:** El contexto confirma que ""El perro está jugando"".
3.  **La consecuencia según María:** ""...Antonio leerá un libro"".

Dado que la condición que María puso se cumplió, la consecuencia de su afirmación es que Antonio leyó un libro.

(Es importante notar que esto contradice el otro dato del contexto que dice ""Antonio no leyó ningún libro"", lo que significa que la afirmación de María resultó ser incorrecta)."
S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no se puede saber.

La afirmación de María es una condición: Antonio leería **si** el perro estuviera jugando.

Como el perro **no** está jugando, la condición no se cumple. Por lo tanto, no podemos saber qué hizo Antonio. Pudo haber leído por otro motivo o no haber leído en absoluto."
S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Sí, **es verdad que Ana trajo donuts.**

La lógica es la siguiente:
1.  **La condición:** María dijo que si la nevera estaba vacía, pasaría algo.
2.  **El hecho:** El contexto confirma que la nevera está vacía.
3.  **La consecuencia:** Al cumplirse la condición, la consecuencia (""Ana traerá donuts"") debe ser cierta.

El que el horno esté estropeado es información extra que no afecta a la afirmación de María."
S9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. Ana no trajo donuts. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Según la lógica de lo que dijo María, **sí, debería ser verdad que Ana trajo donuts**.

La razón es la siguiente:
1.  María dijo: ""**Si** la nevera está vacía, **entonces** Ana traerá donuts"".
2.  La primera parte de la condición (""la nevera está vacía"") se cumple.
3.  Por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, la segunda parte (""Ana traerá donuts"") debería haber ocurrido.

Sin embargo, el propio contexto nos dice que ""Ana no trajo donuts"", lo que significa que **lo que María dijo resultó ser falso**."
