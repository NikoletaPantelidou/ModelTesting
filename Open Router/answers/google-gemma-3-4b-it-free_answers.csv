B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven.” We know John *is* hungry. Therefore, the “if” part of the statement is true, and the “then” part *must* also be true.

B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary’s statement is a conditional statement: “If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven.”  We know John *is* hungry. However, conditional statements only tell us what happens *if* the first part (the hypothesis) is true. They don't tell us what happens if the first part is false.

Since John is hungry, and Mary says pizza would be in the oven *if* he was hungry, the statement doesn't guarantee pizza is there. It simply means that *if* he were hungry, it would be true.

The fact that there's no pizza in the oven contradicts Mary's statement."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven.”  Since we know John is *not* hungry, the condition is not met.  A conditional statement is only false when the condition is true and the conclusion is false.  Because the condition (John being hungry) is false, the statement as a whole is true regardless of whether there's pizza in the oven or not. 

It's possible there *is* pizza in the oven, but Mary's statement doesn't guarantee it.

Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If Nicole’s head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.” We know Nicole’s head hurts. Therefore, the “if” part of the statement is true, and the “then” part *must* also be true according to Mary’s logic.

Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If Nicole’s head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.”  We know Nicole’s head hurts. However, the statement doesn’t say that *only* if her head hurts is there aspirin. It’s possible there’s aspirin there for other reasons.

Since we know there’s no aspirin on the table, Mary’s statement is false."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If Nicole’s head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table.”  Since Nicole’s head *doesn’t* hurt, the condition is not met.  The conditional statement tells us nothing about whether aspirin is actually on the table.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.” We know Lucy *is* thirsty. However, the statement doesn’t say that thirst *always* means there’s water. It simply states what happens *if* she’s thirsty. Since there’s no water, the condition isn’t met. 

This is a classic example of why you can't reverse a conditional statement.
"
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""  Since Lucy is *not* thirsty, the condition is false.  Conditional statements are only false when the condition is true and the conclusion is false.  Because the condition is false, the statement as a whole is true regardless of whether there's water in the fridge or not. However, the question asks if it *is* true that there is water in the fridge. Since Lucy isn't thirsty, Mary's statement doesn't tell us anything about whether there's water in the fridge. It's possible there is, or it's not."

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If Peter’s phone is dead, then there is a charger in the drawer.”  We know Peter’s phone *is* dead. However, Mary’s statement doesn’t say that the *only* reason a charger might be in the drawer is because his phone is dead. 

It’s possible there’s a charger in the drawer for another reason.  Her statement only tells us what *would* be true *if* the phone was dead.
"
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No.

Mary’s statement is a conditional one: “If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack.” The context tells us the weather *is* rainy, but it also tells us there’s *no* umbrella on the coat rack. This contradicts Mary’s statement."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack.” The weather is sunny, which contradicts the condition of her statement. Therefore, her statement doesn't tell us anything about whether or not there's an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage.” We know your tire *is* flat. Therefore, the “if” part of her statement is true. In logic, a conditional statement is only false if the “if” part is true and the “then” part is false. Since the “if” part is true, the “then” part (that there’s a pump in the garage) must also be true for her statement to hold.
"

S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not necessarily true that Angela took a selfie.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If the playground is empty, then Angela will take a selfie.”  The playground *is* empty, but that doesn't guarantee Angela took a selfie. She might have chosen not to, even though the condition for her taking a selfie was met. 

This is a classic example of why conditional statements don't work in reverse.

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","We cannot determine if Paul got 50 euros. Mary’s statement is a conditional one: *if* Paul mows the lawn, *then* he gets 50 euros. We know the “if” part (Paul mowing the lawn) happened. However, we don’t know if he *actually* got the 50 euros. He might have gotten it anyway, or he might not have. 

The statement only tells us what *would* happen *if* he mowed the lawn."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not necessarily true. Mary’s statement was a conditional one: *if* Paul mows the lawn, *then* he will get 50 euros. The context tells us the lawn *was* mowed, but it doesn't tell us if Paul actually got the money. He might have done other things, or Mary might have been mistaken."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","We cannot determine if Paul got 50 euros. Mary’s statement is a conditional one: *if* Paul mows the lawn, *then* he gets 50 euros. However, we don't know if Paul mowed the lawn. The lawn being un-mowed simply tells us the condition wasn't met. 

Therefore, the answer is: **Not necessarily.**

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.” The dog *is* playing. However, the statement doesn’t say what happens if the dog *isn’t* playing. Since the condition (dog playing) is met, the consequence (Anthony reading) *should* happen according to Mary. But we know Anthony didn't read a book. This means Mary’s statement is false.

S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not necessarily true that Anthony read a book.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: “If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.” This only tells us what happens *if* the dog is playing.

He might have, he might not have – we simply don’t know based on Mary’s words.
