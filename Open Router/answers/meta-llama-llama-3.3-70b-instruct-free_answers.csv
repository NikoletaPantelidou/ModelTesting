Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ";"Yes, according to Mary's statement, since Lucy is indeed thirsty, it must be true that there is water in the fridge. Mary's statement is a conditional statement of the form ""If A, then B"" (where A is ""Lucy is thirsty"" and B is ""there is water in the fridge""), and since the condition A is met (Lucy is thirsty), we can conclude that B is also true (there is water in the fridge)."

B3C;English;"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ";"Based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is water in the fridge. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Since Lucy is not thirsty (as given in the context), the condition is not met, and we cannot determine the truth of the statement about water being in the fridge. In other words, the statement is only relevant if Lucy is thirsty, which is not the case. Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is water in the fridge based on Mary's statement."

B5T;English;"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car.

However, the condition ""A"" (the weather is rainy) is true, but the consequence ""B"" (there is an umbrella on the coat rack) is false, as we are given that there is no umbrella on the coat rack. This means that Mary's statement is false."
B5C;English;"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?";"No, it is not necessarily true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"".

The statement only guarantees the presence of an umbrella if it is raining, which is not the case."

Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Since the condition (the tire being flat) is not met, we cannot infer the truth of the conclusion (there being a pump in the garage). In other words, Mary's statement only guarantees the presence of a pump in the garage if the tire is flat, but it does not provide any information about the presence of a pump when the tire is not flat. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the statement ""there is a pump in the garage"" based on Mary's statement alone."

However, the initial context states that there is no water can on the shelf, making Mary's conclusion false in this scenario. Therefore, according to the information given, there is no water can on the shelf, contradicting Mary's statement."
B7C;English;"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ";No, it's not necessarily true.

B8T;English;"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?";"Yes, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?";"No.

Explanation: Mary's statement is a conditional statement of the form ""If A, then B"", where A is ""George's shirt is wrinkled"" and B is ""there is an iron in the closet"". Since we know that George's shirt is indeed wrinkled (A is true), but there is no iron in the closet (B is false), Mary's statement is false. Therefore, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet."
B8C;English;"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?";"Based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is an iron in the closet. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Since we know that George's shirt is not wrinkled, the condition is not met, and we cannot infer the truth of the conclusion (i.e., whether there is an iron in the closet).

In other words, Mary's statement only tells us what would be the case if George's shirt were wrinkled, but it doesn't provide information about the current state of the closet. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there is an iron in the closet based on Mary's statement alone."

S7T;English;"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?";"According to Mary, ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Since the lawn has been mowed, and there is no information suggesting that someone else mowed it, we can infer that Paul mowed the lawn. Therefore, based on Mary's statement, it is true that Paul got 50 euros."
S7F;English;"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?";No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros. According to Mary, Paul would get 50 euros if he mowed the lawn. Since the lawn has been mowed, but it is stated that Paul did not get 50 euros, we can infer that someone else must have mowed the lawn, not Paul.
S7C;English;"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?";"No, based on what Mary said, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.

S8T;English;"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?";"Based on what Mary said, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"", and given that the dog is indeed playing, then according to Mary's statement, Anthony will read a book. Therefore, the answer is: Yes, it is true that Anthony will read a book."

According to Mary, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Since the dog is indeed playing, but it is stated that ""Anthony did not read a book"", this means that Mary's statement is not true in this case. Therefore, it is not true that Anthony read a book."

S9T;English;"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?";"According to Mary's statement, ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Since the fridge is indeed empty, we can conclude that Amy will bring donuts. However, it doesn't necessarily mean she has already brought donuts. The statement only guarantees that she will bring donuts, not that she has already done so.

So, based on the information provided, we cannot confirm that Amy has brought donuts, only that she is expected to do so."

B1F;Spanish;"Aqu√≠ tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y no hay pizza en el horno. Tampoco hay pasta en la nevera. Mar√≠a dice""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Seg√∫n lo que dice Mar√≠a, ¬øes verdad que hay pizza en el hor";"No, nada m√°s lo contrario. Mar√≠a dice qu""si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"".

B1C;Spanish;"Aqu√≠ tienes el contexto: Juan no tiene hambre. Hay pasta en la nevera. Mar√≠a dice""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Seg√∫n lo que dice Mar√≠a, ¬øes verdad que hay pizza en el hor";"Seg√∫n la informaci√≥n proporcionada, Mar√≠a dic""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Sin embargo, tambi√©n se menciona que Juan no tiene hambre. La condici√≥n establecida por Mar√≠a para que haya pizza en el horno es que Juan tenga hambre, lo cual no es el caso.

Por lo tanto, seg√∫n la l√≥gica de la condici√≥n establecida por Mar√≠a y el hecho de que Juan no tiene hambre, no se puede concluir directamente que haya pizza en el horno bas√°ndonos solo en la informaci√≥n dada. La condici√≥n para la existencia de pizza en el horno (Juan tener hambre) no se cumple, pero esto no necesariamente significa que no haya pizza en el horno; solamente significa que, seg√∫n lo dicho por Mar√≠a, no hay una raz√≥n dada para creer que haya pizza en el horno basada en su condici√≥n.

Sin embargo, la pregunta busca una respuesta m√°s directa sobre la afirmaci√≥n de Mar√≠a en el contexto dado. En t√©rminos l√≥gicos, la afir""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"" no se refuta por el hecho de que Juan no tenga hambre; simplemente significa que la condici√≥n para la pizza no se ha cumplido. La afirmaci√≥n condicional en s√≠ no es falsa solo porque la condici√≥n no se cumpla; es m√°s sobre la relaci√≥n l√≥gica entre la condici√≥n y el resultado.

Por lo tanto, sin m√°s informaci√≥n que contradiga directamente la existencia de pizza en el horno, y considerando solo la condici√≥n dada, no podemos decir con certeza que la afirmaci√≥n de Mar√≠a sobre la pizza sea falsa bas√°ndonos en que Juan no tiene hambre. La pregunta parece buscar una respuesta que considere la l√≥gica de la condici√≥n, pero tambi√©n es importante notar que, estrictamente hablando, no hay informaci√≥n suficiente para confirmar o denegar con certeza la presencia de pizza en el horno basada solo en lo que Mar√≠a dice y el estado de hambre de Juan.

En este contexto, la respuesta m√°s precisa ser√≠a que, seg√∫n lo que dice Mar√≠a, no podemos confirmar que haya pizza en el horno porque la condici√≥n que ellhambre) no se cumple, pero esto no implica necesariamente que su afirmaci√≥n sobre la pizza sea falsa en s√≠ misma. La afirmaci√≥n se basa en una condici√≥n que no se cumple, por lo que no se activa la parte de la condici√≥n que ""hay pizza en el horno""."
