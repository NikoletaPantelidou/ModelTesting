B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on what Mary says, ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"", and given that John is indeed hungry, then according to Mary's statement, it is true that there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven. Mary's statement ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"" is a conditional statement, but we know that John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. This means that Mary's statement is false, because the condition (John being hungry) is met, but the consequence (there being pizza in the oven) is not."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on what Mary says, ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"", we cannot conclude that there is pizza in the oven. The statement is a conditional statement, and since John is not hungry, the condition is not met. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the statement ""there is pizza in the oven"" based on Mary's statement."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","According to Mary's statement, ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Since Nicole's head indeed hurts, we can conclude that the condition ""Nicole's head hurts"" is true. 

Using modus ponens (a rule of inference), we can deduce that if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, it is true that there is aspirin on the table. 

Answer: Yes."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table. Mary's statement ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"" is a conditional statement, but we already know that Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. This means Mary's statement is false."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is aspirin on the table. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Since Nicole's head does not hurt, the condition is not met, and we cannot determine the truth of the conclusion (i.e., whether there is aspirin on the table).

In other words, Mary's statement only guarantees the presence of aspirin on the table if Nicole's head hurts, which is not the case. Therefore, we cannot infer that there is aspirin on the table based on Mary's statement alone."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, it is true that there is water in the fridge. Mary states, ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge,"" and we know Lucy is indeed thirsty. Therefore, according to Mary's statement, there must be water in the fridge."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge. According to the context, there is no water in the fridge. Mary's statement ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"" is a conditional statement, but since we know Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge, Mary's statement is proven false."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is water in the fridge. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Since Lucy is not thirsty, the condition is not met, and we cannot infer the truth of the statement about water being in the fridge. In other words, Mary's statement does not provide information about the presence of water in the fridge when Lucy is not thirsty."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","According to Mary's statement, ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Since we know that Peter's phone is indeed dead, we can conclude that, based on Mary's statement, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not true that there is a charger in the drawer. Mary's statement is a conditional statement of the form ""If A, then B"", where A is ""Peter's phone is dead"" and B is ""there is a charger in the drawer"". Since Peter's phone is indeed dead, but we know there is no charger in the drawer, Mary's statement is false. This means that the conclusion ""there is a charger in the drawer"" does not follow from the premise ""Peter's phone is dead"", so we can conclude that there is no charger in the drawer."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot conclude that there is a charger in the drawer. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Since Peter's phone is actually fully charged (not dead), the condition is not met, and we cannot infer the truth of the consequent (i.e., whether there is a charger in the drawer). In other words, Mary's statement only tells us what would be the case if Peter's phone were dead, but it doesn't provide information about the current state of the drawer. Therefore, we cannot determine whether there is a charger in the drawer based on Mary's statement alone."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Mary states that ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"", and given that the weather is indeed rainy, her statement implies that there should be an umbrella on the coat rack, which is consistent with the information provided."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Mary's statement is a conditional statement of the form ""If A, then B"" (If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack). However, the condition ""A"" (the weather is rainy) is true, but the consequence ""B"" (there is an umbrella on the coat rack) is false, as we are given that there is no umbrella on the coat rack. This means that Mary's statement is false."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Since the weather is actually sunny, the condition (rainy weather) is not met, so we cannot conclude that the umbrella is on the coat rack. Additionally, the presence of a raincoat in the car is irrelevant to Mary's statement."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"".

B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No.

Explanation: According to Mary's statement, ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Since we know that the tire is indeed flat, but there is no pump in the garage, Mary's statement is false. This is an example of a conditional statement (if-then), and the falsity of the conclusion (there is a pump in the garage) when the premise (the tire is flat) is true indicates that the statement as a whole is false."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","We can't conclude that for certain. Mary's statement only guarantees that there is a pump in the garage if the tire is flat, but since the tire is not flat, we don't have enough information to determine whether or not there is a pump in the garage."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf. According to the context, there is no water can on the shelf, which directly contradicts Mary's statement. Mary's statement is a conditional statement (""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf""), but since the condition (the plant being dry) is true, and the conclusion (there being a water can on the shelf) is false, Mary's statement as a whole is false."

Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Since the plant is not dry, the condition is not met, and we cannot conclude that there is a water can on the shelf. The presence of a hose in the garden is also irrelevant to Mary's statement."

Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is a conditional statement that says ""if George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"".

Mary's statement is a conditional statement: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Since we know that George's shirt is not wrinkled, the condition is not met, and we cannot infer the truth of the conclusion (i.e., whether there is an iron in the closet). Therefore, we cannot determine if there is an iron in the closet based on Mary's statement alone."

According to the context, there are no books on the shelf, which contradicts what Mary says. Therefore, Mary's statement is false."

Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Based on what Mary says, it is likely that there are books on the shelf, but we cannot conclude this with absolute certainty. Mary's statement is conditional, indicating that if Susy wants to read, the books on the shelf are an option. However, Mary does not directly affirm the existence of books on the shelf, regardless of Susy's desire to read. Nonetheless, given the context and the purpose of Mary's statement, it is reasonable to infer that Mary believes there are books on the shelf."

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","According to Mary's statement, ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Since the parrot is indeed in the cage, we can conclude that Thomas will bring pizza. However, the statement only guarantees that Thomas ""will bring"" pizza, not that he has already brought it.

So, based on Mary's statement alone, we can't confirm that Thomas has already brought pizza, but we can infer that he is expected to bring pizza. The correct answer would be ""We can't say for sure, but it's expected that Thomas will bring pizza""."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza. According to Mary's statement, ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"".

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza.

S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is not true that Susan got a camera. According to the information given, the condition for Susan getting a camera was that the foxes are dancing, but it was also stated that Susan did not get a shovel, and more importantly, there is no mention of her getting a camera. The statement from Mary sets up a condition for Susan getting a camera (if the foxes are dancing), but since we are not told that Susan got a camera and are instead given information about her not getting a shovel, we cannot conclude she got a camera based on the given information. However, the direct answer to whether Susan got a camera, based on what is explicitly stated, is no, she did not get a camera because the text does not confirm she received one."

However, since Matthew did not bake cookies despite the TV being on, Mary's statement is proven false in this instance."

S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Yes, it is true that Paul got 50 euros. According to Mary, if Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros, and since the lawn has been mowed, it can be inferred that Paul was the one who mowed it and therefore received the 50 euros."

According to Mary, Paul would get 50 euros if he mowed the lawn. Since the lawn has been mowed, it can be inferred that Paul did mow the lawn.

S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Based on what Mary said, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"", and given that the dog is indeed playing, it can be inferred that Anthony will read a book. However, the statement only guarantees that Anthony ""will read a book"" if the condition is met, but it does not confirm that he has already read a book. Since the dog is playing, it is likely that Anthony is reading or will read a book, but without further information, we cannot confirm with absolute certainty that he has already done so. Nevertheless, based on the given condition and its fulfillment, it is reasonable to conclude that Anthony is expected to read a book."

Mary's statement ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"" is a conditional statement, and since the dog is indeed playing, the condition is met. However, the outcome is not as Mary predicted, as Anthony did not read a book. This means Mary's statement is proven false in this scenario."

Tanmateix, el context també especifica que ""l'Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre"". Això significa que, malgrat la condició establerta per la Maria, l'Antoni no ha complert amb l'acció de llegir un llibre.

Per tant, la resposta a la pregunta és: No, no és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre, ja que el context diu explícitament que no ha llegit cap llibre, contradient la predició o condició establerta per la Maria."

Maria afferma che se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, allora c'è un caricatore nel cassetto, e poiché il telefono di Pietro è effettivamente scarico, la condizione per l'esistenza del caricatore nel cassetto è soddisfatta.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, allora c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"".

Poiché la condizione ""il tempo è piovoso"" è vera e non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli, allora l'affermazione di Maria è falsa.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No, non è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. La frase di Maria è una condizione: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". Tuttavia, sappiamo che la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Quindi, la condizione affermata da Maria non è vera.

In logica, questo tipo di argomento si chiama ""modus tollens"" e può essere rappresentato come segue:

- Se A, allora B (Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio)
- A è vera (la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata)
- B è falsa (non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio)

Quindi, la conclusione è che l'affermazione originale ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"" è falsa. In questo caso, poiché sappiamo che non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio e la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, l'affermazione di Maria è contraddetta dai fatti."
