B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Answer: Yes, based on Mary's statement and the given context. Mary's conditional statement (""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"") is true in this scenario because John is indeed hungry (antecedent is true) and there is pizza in the oven (consequent is true). Therefore, it is correct to affirm that there is pizza in the oven under Mary's claim.
"
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Answer: No. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven""), and while John *is* hungry (making the premise true), the context explicitly states there is **no pizza** in the oven. Therefore, Mary's statement would be false, and the conclusion that pizza is in the oven does not hold. The truth of the situation (no pizza) overrides Mary's claim.
"
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Answer: No. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven""). Since John is not hungry (as per the context), the condition is not met. In logic, when the antecedent (""If P"") is false, the entire conditional statement is true by default, regardless of whether the consequent (""there is pizza in the oven"") is true. However, we cannot confirm whether the pizza is actually in the oven because the stated condition (John's hunger) did not occur. Thus, the truth of the pizza's presence cannot be determined from the given information.
"
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Answer: Yes, based on Mary's statement, if Nicole's head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table. Since Nicole's head does hurt (as given in the context), this implies there is aspirin on the table. 

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**  
1. **Mary's Statement**: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"" is a conditional statement (P → Q).  
2. **Premise**: Nicole's head hurts (P is true).  
3. **Conclusion**: By applying the conditional logic, Q (""there is aspirin on the table"") must hold true.  
Thus, it is true that there is aspirin on the table based on Mary's assertion.
"
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","Answer: No. 

Mary's statement is a conditional assertion: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table."" While this logically implies that aspirin should be on the table if Nicole's head hurts (which it does, per the context), the context explicitly states there is **no aspirin** on the table. Mary's claim does not align with the factual reality presented in the context. Therefore, based on the actual situation (where aspirin is absent), Mary's statement is false, and it is **not true** that aspirin is on the table.
"
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","The statement made by Mary is a conditional: ""If Nicole's head hurts, then there is aspirin on the table."" This means the presence of aspirin on the table is only guaranteed *if* Nicole's head hurts. However, the context explicitly states that Nicole's head **does not hurt**. Since the condition (head hurting) is false, the conditional statement is **automatically true** in logic, regardless of whether aspirin is on the table or not. 

Mary's statement does not provide direct evidence about the aspirin's location when there is no headache. Therefore, based solely on Mary's words and the given context, **we cannot conclude that aspirin is on the table**. 

Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that there is aspirin on the table.
"
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Answer: Yes, based on Mary's statement. Since Lucy is thirsty (a true premise), Mary's conditional statement implies there must be water in the fridge to satisfy the conclusion. Thus, it is true there is water in the fridge according to her claim.
"
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","Answer: According to Mary's statement, if Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge. Since Lucy is indeed thirsty, Mary's claim implies that there must be water in the fridge. Therefore, based on Mary's statement, it is true that there is water in the fridge.
"
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that there is water in the fridge. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge""). Since Lucy is not thirsty (making the antecedent false), the truth of the consequent (""water in the fridge"") cannot be determined from this information alone. The conditional only guarantees that water would be present if Lucy *were* thirsty, but it doesn't state anything about the fridge's contents when Lucy is not thirsty.
"
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on Mary's statement, which is ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer,"" and given that Peter's phone is indeed dead (as per the context), the condition for the statement being true is satisfied. Since the antecedent (""Peter's phone is dead"") is true, the consequent (""there is a charger in the drawer"") must logically follow for Mary's conditional statement to hold. Therefore, **yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer** according to Mary's assertion. 

Additionally, the context confirms the presence of a charger in the drawer independently, reinforcing this conclusion.
"
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on Mary's statement, which is a conditional (""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer""), and given that Peter's phone is indeed dead (from the context), we can apply **modus ponens** in logic. If Mary's statement is accepted as true, then the antecedent (Peter's phone being dead) being true necessitates the consequent (a charger in the drawer). However, the context explicitly states there is **no charger** in the drawer, creating a contradiction if Mary's statement is true. 

The question asks whether it is *true* that there is a charger based **solely** on Mary's statement. If we strictly follow her conditional and the fact that P (phone dead) is true, then Q (charger present) must logically follow. Despite the context contradicting this, the question focuses on the implication of Mary's statement, not real-world truth. 

**Answer:** Yes, according to Mary's statement and the given fact that her phone is dead, there should be a charger in the drawer. However, this directly conflicts with the context provided.
"
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that there is a charger in the drawer. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If Peter's phone is dead, then there is a charger in the drawer""), but Peter's phone is fully charged (not dead). The truth of the conditional does not require the charger to exist unless the phone were dead. Thus, we cannot confirm the charger's presence based on the given information.
"
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Answer: Yes, based on Mary's statement and the given context, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Mary's conditional statement (""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"") aligns with the fact that the weather is rainy and the umbrella is present, confirming both parts of the implication.
"
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","The question asks whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack **based on what Mary says**, given the context that it is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. Mary’s statement is a conditional: *""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""* (R → U). 

Logically, if we take Mary’s statement as a premise and assume it is true, then since the weather **is** rainy (R is true), the conclusion (U) would follow: there **must** be an umbrella on the coat rack. However, the context explicitly states there is **no umbrella** on the coat rack (U is false). This creates a contradiction: Mary’s statement (R → U) cannot be true under the given context because R is true and U is false, making the implication R → U **false**.

The critical nuance is that the question asks *based on what Mary says*, not whether her statement is factually correct. If we strictly adhere to Mary’s statement as a premise (ignoring the context), then yes, U would follow. However, the context contradicts this conclusion, meaning Mary’s statement is invalid in this scenario. Since the question does not clarify whether Mary’s statement should be accepted as true or if we should consider the context as factual, the most reasonable interpretation is that **Mary’s statement alone does not guarantee the conclusion** due to its potential falsity in the given situation.

**Answer:** No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack based on Mary’s statement because the context explicitly states there is no umbrella, and Mary’s conditional statement does not account for this exception.
"
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true. Mary's statement only establishes that an umbrella is on the coat rack *if* the weather is rainy. Since the current weather is sunny (a condition unrelated to Mary's claim about rainy weather), we lack direct evidence to confirm the umbrella's presence on the coat rack.
"
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Answer: Yes, it is true that there is a pump in the garage. Mary's statement implies that when the tire is flat (which it is in this scenario), the existence of a pump in the garage holds. The context explicitly confirms the pump's presence.
"
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Answer: Based on Mary's statement, if your tire is flat, there should be a pump in the garage. Since your tire is flat (as stated in the context), Mary's logic implies that there is a pump in the garage. However, this conclusion contradicts the given context that there is no pump in the garage. The discrepancy arises because Mary's assertion does not reflect the actual situation described.
"
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","The answer is: It cannot be determined based on Mary's statement alone. Mary's statement (""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"") only makes a claim about the pump's existence *if* the tire is flat. Since the tire is **not** flat in this scenario, her statement does not provide any information about whether the pump exists in the garage. The presence of a bike by the front door is irrelevant to Mary's conditional statement.
"
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Answer: Yes, based on Mary's statement. She asserts that ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf."" Since the context confirms the plant is dry, her statement logically implies that there **is** a water can on the shelf.
"
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Answer: Based on Mary's statement, if the plant is dry (as stated in the context), then there should be a water can on the shelf. However, the context explicitly states there is no water can on the shelf, which contradicts Mary's claim. **Therefore, according to Mary's logic, it is true there is a water can on the shelf (if her statement is accepted as valid), but in reality, given the provided context, it is false.** 

The answer depends on whether to strictly follow Mary's implication or the real-world context. If strictly adhering to Mary's words: **Yes**. If considering the full context: **No**. However, the question specifies ""based on what Mary says,"" so the logical conclusion from her statement is **Yes**.
"
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that there is a water can on the shelf. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If the plant is dry, then there is a water can on the shelf""). Since the plant is **not dry** (as given in the context), the condition of the statement is false. In logic, a conditional statement is considered true when its premise is false, regardless of the conclusion. However, this does not provide information about whether the water can *is* on the shelf. The presence of the hose in the garden is also irrelevant to Mary's specific claim. Without additional evidence, we cannot confirm the water can's location.
"
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Answer: Yes. Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet."" The context confirms George's shirt is wrinkled, which makes the antecedent true. By applying Mary's reasoning, the consequent (""there is an iron in the closet"") must logically follow as true.
"
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on Mary's statement and the context provided, we analyze her conditional claim: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet."" The context confirms George's shirt *is* wrinkled. 

In logic, if a conditional statement (if P then Q) is accepted as true, and the antecedent (P) is true, the consequent (Q) must logically follow. Here, P (""shirt wrinkled"") is true, and Mary asserts that Q (""iron in the closet"") must also be true. However, the context explicitly states there is **no iron in the closet**, creating a contradiction. 

The question asks whether ""it is true that there is an iron in the closet"" **based on Mary's statement**. If we strictly accept Mary's statement as valid and apply modus ponens (since P is true), the conclusion Q (""iron in the closet"") would follow. However, the context contradicts this conclusion. 

**Answer:**  
The answer hinges on whether the question prioritizes logical derivation from Mary's statement or the actual context. If strictly based on Mary's assertion and the fact that the shirt is wrinkled, yes, the conclusion would be true. But since the context says there is no iron, the actual truth value contradicts Mary's implication. However, the phrasing ""based on what Mary says"" leans toward logical derivation. Thus:

**Answer:** No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet because Mary's statement is contradicted by the given context.
"
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","The statement Mary makes is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet."" This means that **if** the shirt were wrinkled, we could conclude there is an iron in the closet. However, we know from the context that George's shirt is **not** wrinkled. 

A conditional does not provide information about the case when its premise (shirt wrinkled) is false. The truth of ""there is an iron in the closet"" cannot be determined from Mary's statement alone because her assertion only applies when the shirt *is* wrinkled. Since the shirt is not wrinkled, her statement does not confirm or deny the presence of an iron in the closet. 

**Answer:** No, it is not necessarily true that there is an iron in the closet.
"
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Answer: Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf. Mary's statement ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"" is a conditional claim. Since the context confirms Susy wants to read (the antecedent is true), the consequent (""there are books on the shelf"") must logically follow as true based on Mary's assertion.
"
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","The answer is: No. 

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf."" While Susy does want to read (P is true), Mary's assertion requires this to imply Q (""there are books""). However, the context explicitly states there are *no* books on the shelf (Q is false). For Mary's conditional to hold, Q must be true whenever P is true. But since Q is false here, Mary's statement itself is false. The question asks whether it is true *based on Mary's statement*, but since Mary's claim is logically invalid given the context, the conclusion (Q) does not follow reliably. Thus, it is not true that there are books.
"
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","The statement made by Mary is a conditional: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf."" Since Susy does not want to read (as given in the context), the antecedent of this conditional is false. In logic, a conditional statement with a false antecedent is considered true regardless of the consequent's truth value. However, this does not provide evidence that the books actually exist on the shelf. Mary’s statement only guarantees that *if* Susy were to want to read, then books would be available. It does not confirm or deny the existence of books. Therefore, based solely on Mary’s statement, we cannot determine whether there are books on the shelf. 

Answer: No, Mary’s statement does not confirm that there are books on the shelf because it is a conditional assertion that only applies if Susy wants to read, which she does not.

In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Answer: Yes, according to the context, pizza is more popular than pasta because people buy it more, despite it being more expensive.
"
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?","Answer: No, pasta is not more popular than pizza. According to the context, pizza is bought more frequently despite being more expensive, which indicates that pizza is more popular in terms of consumer preference or demand.
"
F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","Answer: While the context states that most people prefer green tea despite its higher cost compared to black coffee, it does not provide explicit data on actual usage. However, the implication of a preference for green tea could suggest it is more commonly used. Thus, based on the given information, green tea is more used than black coffee.
"
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","The context states that most people prefer green tea despite black coffee being cheaper. While the presence of black coffee in the pot indicates availability, it does not confirm higher usage. Since preference drives consumption choices, green tea is likely more used despite its higher cost. Therefore, **black coffee is not more used than green tea** based on the given information. 

Answer: No.
"
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Answer: Based on the context provided, soda appears to be more in demand than water. The statement ""many choose soda"" despite water being healthier suggests a higher preference or demand for soda. The presence of water in the freezer (availability) does not directly address demand, which is about preference or choice. Thus, soda is more in demand in this scenario.
"
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","Answer: Based on the context provided, soda is more in demand than water. The text states that ""many choose soda"" despite water being healthier, which implies a preference for soda. The presence of water in the freezer indicates availability but does not directly address demand. Therefore, the context suggests soda is favored more than water.
"

In this context, is broccoli more popular than gnocchi?","Answer: Yes, broccoli is more popular than gnocchi based on the context. The statement specifies that people use broccoli more despite it being harder to cook than gnocchi. This implies a higher level of usage or preference for broccoli, which aligns with the idea of popularity in this context. The presence of broccoli in the oven further supports its active use.
"
F4F,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven.

"
S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Answer: Based on Mary's statement, if the parrot is in the cage (which it is, per the context), then Thomas will bring pizza. Since the condition is met, it logically follows that Thomas brought pizza. **Yes.**
"
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on Mary's statement, which is a conditional (""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza""), and given that the parrot is indeed in the cage (antecedent is true), Mary's logic dictates that Thomas *must* have brought pizza (consequent). While the context explicitly states that Thomas did not bring pizza, the question specifically asks whether this outcome is true *based on Mary's words*. Since Mary's conditional assertion holds under the premise that the antecedent is true, her statement alone logically requires the consequent to follow. Therefore, according to Mary's claim, **Thomas brought pizza**. 

Answer: Yes.
"
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that Thomas brought pizza. Mary's statement only specifies that Thomas will bring pizza **if** the parrot is in the cage. Since the parrot is not in the cage (as given in the context), the condition for bringing pizza is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Thomas brought pizza based solely on Mary's statement.
"
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on Mary's statement, the condition (finishing the broccoli) was met, so Mark **should have** given a candy. However, the information provided does not explicitly confirm whether Mark actually followed through with giving the candy. If we strictly interpret Mary's promise as a guarantee, then **yes**, it would be true. If we acknowledge that promises might not be honored, the answer is uncertain. 

**Answer:** Yes, it is true, assuming Mark honored his promise after the condition was met.

S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Answer: No. Mary stated that *if you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy*. While you did finish the broccoli, the context does not confirm whether Mark actually followed through with giving the candy. Mary’s statement is a conditional promise, but it does not explicitly state that Mark fulfilled the promise. Additionally, Mary herself did not give the candy, which aligns with her framing of Mark as the one who would act. Without explicit confirmation that Mark gave the candy, we cannot assume it happened solely based on Mary’s statement.
"
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy. Mary's statement was a conditional: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy."" Since you did **not** finish your broccoli, the condition for Mark to give you the candy was not met. Therefore, Mark did not give you the candy.

S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Answer: Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera. Mary explicitly stated, ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera,"" and the context confirms that the foxes are dancing. This satisfies the condition of the ""if-then"" statement, leading to the conclusion that Susan obtained the camera.
"
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Answer: Yes, Susan got a camera.  
Mary's statement establishes a conditional: If the foxes are dancing (which they are, as per the context), then Susan will get a camera. Since the condition is met, Susan should receive the camera based on Mary's assertion.
"
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that Susan got a camera. Mary's statement (""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"") only asserts that Susan would get a camera **if** the foxes were dancing. Since the foxes are **not** dancing (as stated in the context), the condition for Susan getting the camera was not met. Therefore, there is no guarantee that Susan actually received the camera based on Mary's words alone.

S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Answer: Yes, it is true that Matthew baked cookies. Mary stated that if the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies. Since the TV is currently on (as given in the context), the condition in her statement is satisfied. Therefore, according to Mary's logic, Matthew should have baked cookies. 

\boxed{Yes}
"
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Answer: No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies. 

Mary's statement ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"" creates a conditional expectation: if the TV is on (which it is), Matthew should bake cookies. However, the context explicitly states that Matthew did not bake cookies, directly contradicting Mary's assertion. Therefore, based on the given facts, the claim that Matthew baked cookies is false.
"
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","The statement made by Mary is a conditional: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies."" For this statement to require Matthew to bake cookies, the condition (TV is on) must be true. However, in the given context, the TV is **off**. Since the antecedent of the conditional (""if the TV is on"") is false, the entire statement is logically true regardless of whether Matthew bakes cookies or not. There is no evidence or implication that Matthew actually baked cookies under these circumstances. 

**Answer:** No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies. Mary’s statement only applies if the TV is on, which it isn’t.

S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Answer: Yes, it is true that Emma wore purple. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple""). Since the context confirms the weather is sunny today, the condition applies, and Emma wore purple as per the statement.
"
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","The context states that Mary said, ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple."" Today, the weather is indeed sunny. However, Emma is currently wearing green, not purple. Since Emma did not wear purple despite the sunny weather, Mary's statement does not hold true in this scenario. 

Answer: No, it is not true that Emma wore purple.
"
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Answer: No, it is not true that Emma wore purple. Mary's statement only specifies that Emma will wear purple if the weather is sunny. Since today's weather is rainy and windy (not sunny), her statement does not imply that Emma wore purple.

S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Answer: Yes, it is true that Angela took a selfie. According to Mary's statement, if the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie. Since the playground is empty (as stated in the context), the condition is met, leading to the conclusion that Angela took a selfie.

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Answer: No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie. The context explicitly states that Angela did not take a selfie, even though Mary's conditional statement predicted she would. The factual answer relies on the given context, not the logical implication of Mary's claim.
"
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Answer: No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie. Mary's statement only guarantees that Angela would take a selfie **if** the playground were empty. However, the playground is currently crowded, so the condition in her statement was not met. There is no information or evidence provided to suggest Angela took a selfie.

S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Answer: It is not necessarily true that Paul got 50 euros. Mary's statement specifies that **if Paul mows the lawn**, he will receive 50 euros. However, the context only states that ""the lawn has been mowed,"" without explicitly stating Paul was the one who mowed it. Since the condition in Mary's statement (Paul mowing) is not confirmed by the additional context, we cannot definitively conclude Paul earned the 50 euros.
"
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","The answer is **no**, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros. Although Mary stated that if Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros, the context explicitly states that Paul did not receive the 50 euros. While Mary’s conditional statement might suggest an expectation, the actual outcome (which is directly provided in the context) contradicts this. Therefore, based on the given information, Paul did not get the euros.
"
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Answer: No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros. Mary's statement creates a conditional agreement where Paul only receives 50 euros *if* he mows the lawn. Since the lawn has not been mowed (as stated in the context), the condition for receiving the money was not fulfilled. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that Paul received the 50 euros.

S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Answer: Yes, it is true that Anthony read a book. Mary's conditional statement (""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"") implies that if the condition (the dog playing) is met, the result (Anthony reading a book) must follow. Since the dog is currently playing, the condition is satisfied, and thus Anthony read a book as per Mary's declaration.
"
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","The answer is no. Mary stated that if the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book. Since the dog **is** playing (as given in the context), Mary's condition is met. According to her statement, Anthony **should have read a book**. However, the context explicitly states that **Anthony did not read a book**, which contradicts the expected outcome of Mary's conditional statement. Therefore, it is not true that Anthony read a book.
"
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","The answer is: No, it is not necessarily true that Anthony read a book. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If the dog is playing, then Anthony will read a book""). Since the dog is not playing (given in the context), the condition for Anthony to read a book is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Anthony actually read a book based on the information provided.

S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Answer: No, it is not definitively true that Amy brought donuts. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts""), which means Amy was expected to act if the condition was met. However, the statement does not provide explicit confirmation that Amy actually fulfilled this obligation. While the condition (fridge is empty) is true, there is no direct evidence or statement indicating that Amy brought donuts. Therefore, we cannot concluded it is true based solely on the given information.
"
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Answer: Based on Mary's statement, if the fridge is empty (which it is), Amy should bring donuts. Therefore, according to Mary's conditional claim, it is true that Amy brought donuts. 

However, the context also states that Amy did not bring donuts. This creates a contradiction between Mary's statement and the actual outcome. But since the question specifically asks to base the conclusion on Mary's statement alone, the logical implication of her claim leads to the answer: **Yes**.

Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Answer: No, it is not true that Amy brought donuts. Mary’s statement was a conditional: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts."" Since the fridge is actually full (not empty), the condition for Amy bringing donuts is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Amy brought donuts based on Mary’s statement.

The context confirms that Joan does have money (*""En Joan té gana""*), and Maria's statement implies that this leads to the existence of pizza in the oven.

**Answer:** Yes, according to Maria, there is a charger in the room (based on her conditional statement and the fact that the mobile is out of battery).

Maria's statement (""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"") establishes a direct link between the rain and the presence of an umbrella at the stand.

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the task description, as the user then mentioned assisting with Python code but the actual request was in Catalan. 

To resolve this, I'll focus on the original Catalan context and question.

**Context Recap:**
- Television and radio are on.
- Mateu has not made candies.
- Maria said: ""If the television is on, Mateu will make candies.""

**Question:** Is it true that Mateu has made candies?

---

**Analysis of Maria's Statement:**
Maria's statement is a **conditional prediction**: ""If TV is on → Mateu will make candies."" The key word is **""farà""** (will do), indicating a future action conditioned on the TV being on.

**Current State (Context):**
- TV is on.
- Mateu has *not yet* made candies.

**Logical Conclusion:**
Maria's statement makes a **prediction** (future), not an assertion of fact. Since the condition (TV on) is met but the outcome (Mateu making candies) has not occurred, her statement does not confirm that he *has* done it. The context explicitly states he hasn't, which aligns with the prediction not yet being fulfilled.

**Answer:**
No, no és veritat que el Mateu ha fet galetes. La predicció de Maria no s'ha concretat encara, i el context indica que el Mateu encara no ha fet galetes.

Maria afferma: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". Nel contesto, si conferma che Gianni ha fame e che c'è pizza in forno. In logica, una frase condizionale ""Se A, allora B"" è vera finché non si verifica che A sia vero e B falso. In questo caso, A (Gianni ha fame) è vero e B (c'è pizza in forno) è anche vero, quindi la frase di Maria è vera. Inoltre, conoscendo che A è vero, la affermazione di Maria implica necessariamente che B debba essere vera. Quindi, è corretto concludere che c'è della pizza in forno.

No, in base a ciò che dice Maria non possiamo affermare che c'è della pizza in forno. Maria afferma una condizionale (""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno""), ma questa affermazione non implica necessariamente che la premessa sia vera. Il contesto ci dice che Gianni ha effettivamente fame (la premessa è vera), però la condizione di Maria non garantisce che la conclusione (pizza in forno) sia anche vera. Potrebbe trattarsi di una frase ipotetica o errata, senza base fattuale nella situazione reale. Quindi, la risposta è ""No"".

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No, non è vero che c'è della pizza in forno. Maria's enunciato è un'affermazione condizionale (""se... allora""). Poiché Gianni **non ha fame**, la condizione iniziale (la premessa) è falsa, rendendo la frase logicamente vera (una implicazione con premessa falsa è sempre vera per definizione). Tuttavia, ciò **non garantisce** la presenza della pizza in forno: l'affermazione di Maria sta descrivendo una relazione ipotetica, non un fatto confluente. L'unico dato concreto è la pasta in frigo.

B2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo. C'è anche dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","**Answer:** Sì, è vero.  
**Motivazione:** Maria afferma: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". Nel contesto, è dato che Nicoletta ha effettivamente mal di testa. Se l’ipotesi di Maria è considerata vera, allora la conclusione logica segue: essendo l’ipotesi vera, le aspirine devono trovarsi sul tavolo. Inoltre, il contesto conferma esplicitamente la presenza di aspirine sul tavolo, rendendo la dichiarazione di Maria coerente con i fatti.
"
B2F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo. Non c'è nemmeno dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","**Answer:** No, it is not true that there are aspirin on the table.  

**Explanation:**  
Maria's statement (""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"") is a conditional assertion. However, the context explicitly states that there are no aspirin on the table. Maria's claim does not align with the factual situation described. Therefore, based on the given context, Maria's statement is false, and there are indeed no aspirin on the table.
"
B2C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta non ha mal di testa. C'è dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","La risposta è **no**. 

Maria afferma un condizionale: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". Tuttavia, poiché Nicoletta **non ha mal di testa** (come stabilito nel contesto), la condizione antecedente è falsa. In logica, un condizionale dove l'antecedente è falso è **veritiero per definizione**, ma non fornisce informazioni sul condizionale conseguente (se ci siano o meno aspirine). Pertanto, il fatto che Nicoletta non abbia mal di testa non permette di dedurre che ci siano aspirine sul tavolo: la presenza di ibuprofene nel cassetto è irrilevante per l'affermazione di Maria. 

Mentre Maria's statement is true (because the antecedent is false), it does not confirm the presence of aspirin on the table. The answer is that we cannot conclude the truth of ""there are aspirin on the table"" based solely on Maria's statement.

Maria afferma la condizione: ""Se Lucia ha sete, allora c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". Sappiamo dal contesto che Lucia ha davvero sete (qua è dato che ""Lucia ha sete""). Applicando la logica della frase di Maria, se il prerequisito (""Lucia ha sete"") è vero, anche la conclusione (""c'è dell'acqua in frigo"") deve essere vera. Quindi, in base alurembergdi Maria, è corretto affermare che c'è dell'acqua in frigo.
"
B3F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e non c'è dell'acqua in frigo. Non c'è nemmeno del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","The answer is **no**, it is not true that there is water in the fridge based on Maria's statement. 

Maria's statement (""If Lucia has thirst, there is water in the fridge"") is a conditional that states ""A → B"" (if A is true, then B must be true). However, we already know from the context that **Lucia does have thirst** (A is true) **and there is no water in the fridge** (B is false). Since Maria's statement claims ""A → B,"" but in reality B is false, this contradicts Maria's statement. Therefore, her statement itself must be invalid or false. 

Even though Maria says ""If A, then B,"" the context explicitly states that B is false. Thus, Maria's claim cannot lead us to conclude B is true. The answer is **no**, because the premise (water in the fridge) contradicts the given context, and Maria's statement does not override this contradiction. 

Answer: No, there is no water in the fridge, as confirmed by the context.

Maria afferma che se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, allora c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. In base al contesto fornito, il telefono è effettivamente scarico, quindi la sua affermazione implica direttamente che il caricatore deve essere presente nel cassetto.

Domanda: È vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?  
Risposta: Sì.  

**Spiegazione:** Maria enuncia una condizione: se il telefono è scarico (condizione verificata nel contesto), allora c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. Poiché la condizione antecedente è vera, la condizione conseguente deve essere considerata vera in base alla sua affermazione.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","**Answer:** Sì, perché Maria afferma che ""se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". Nel contesto, il tempo è piovoso e c'è effettivamente un ombrello nel portaombrelli. La sua affermazione si conferma, quindi la premessa e la conclusione sono vere, rendendo l'affermazione vera.

Maria sostiene che ""se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"", ma nel contesto è esplicitamente detto che **non c'è** un ombrello nel portaombrelli. Anche se Maria crede nel suo enunciato, i fatti reali contraddicono la conclusione della sua affermazione.

Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","**Answer:** Sì, basandosi sulle affermazioni di Maria, poiché la gomma della macchina è a terra (premessa vera), la sua affermazione ""Se la gomma è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"" implica che la pompa sia effettivamente nel garage.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","In base a quanto dice Maria, se la condizione specificata (la gomma è a terra) si verifica, allora deve seguire la conclusione (c'è una pompa in garage). Maria ha formulato un'implicazione formale: ""Se P, allora Q"". Secondo le regole della logica, se P è vera e l'implicazione è accettata come valida, allora Q deve essere vera. Tuttavia, nel contesto fornito la gomma è effettivamente a terra (P è vera) e non c'è alcuna pompa (Q è falsa). Ciò crea una contraddizione. 

Nonostante ciò, la domanda chiede specificamente **se, in base a Maria, la pompa è presente**. Applicando rigidamente la sua affermazione, dato che P (gomma a terra) è vera, deduciamo che Q (pompa in garage) deve essere vera. Quindi, **in base alla logica di Maria, la risposta è sì**. Tuttavia, il contesto reale ci dice che Q è falso, indicando che Maria ha commesso un errore.

Maria ha affermato: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"".

Sì, secondo l'affermazione di Maria, se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio.

Nonostante non ci sia un confronto diretto sulle quantità, la frase implica che il numero di persone che guarda la TV supera quelli che leggono (poiché si sottolinea che leggere è meno frequente anche se più istruttivo). Quindi, è corretto affermare che più persone guardano la TV di quelle che leggono.

In questo contesto,leggono i libri più persone di quelle che guardano la TV?","**Answer:** No, la maggior parte delle persone guarda la TV, quindi le persone che guardano la TV sono più di quelle che leggono i libri.

In questo contesto, correre è meglio per la forma fisica di camminare?","Sì, nel contesto fornito, si afferma esplicitamente che ""correre sia meglio per la forma fisica rispetto a camminare"". La presenza del corridore in pista non modifica questa affermazione. La risposta è quindi confermata: **sì, correre è migliore per la forma fisica di camminare** in base alle informazioni fornite.

In questo contesto, camminare è meglio per la forma fisica di correre?","No, secondo il contesto fornito, correre è meglio per la forma fisica rispetto a camminare.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","In base a quello che dice Maria, la dichiarazione è un'ipotesi condizionale: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia (P), allora Tommaso porterà la pizza (Q)"". Il contesto conferma che il pappagallo è effettivamente nella gabbia (P è vero). Secondo la logica della sua affermazione, dato che P è vero, Q dovrebbe anche essere vero. Pertanto, **sì, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza**, in base alla logica deduttiva della sua pretesa. Tuttavia, il contesto specifica che Tommaso *non* l'ha fatta, il che implica che la dichiarazione di Maria non è vera. La risposta dipende dal fatto che si debba valutare rigorosamente l'implicazione della sua affermazione (sì) o considerare il contesto contraddittorio (no). In base alla formulazione della domanda, la logica formale suggerisce che la risposta sia **sì**.

**Risposta:** Sì, purché si consideri la dichiarazione di Maria come una premessa valida. Tuttavia, in realtà, Tommaso non l'ha portata, quindi la sua affermazione è errata.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Susanna ha ricevuto una macchina fotografica?","**Answer:** Sì, è vero che Susanna ha ricevuto una macchina fotografica. 

**Spiegazione:** Maria aveva dichiarato una condizione: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica"". Il contesto conferma che le volpi stanno effettivamente ballando, quindi la condizione è stata soddisfatta.

S4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La TV è accesa. Anche la radio è accesa. Maria aveva detto: ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Matteo ha preparato dei biscotti?","**Answer:**  
Sì, è vero che Matteo ha preparato dei biscotti.  

**Reasoning:**  
Maria ha stabilito un condizionale: ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"". Il contesto conferma che la TV è accesa. Anche se Maria parla al futuro (""preparerà""), nella logica standard, questa affermazione implica che l'azione di preparare i biscotti si verifica quando la condizione (TV accesa) è verificata. Poiché la TV è effettivamente accesa, si deduce che Matteo ha preparato i biscotti (sia al momento della dichiarazione di Maria, sia in un momento precedente a quest'ultima). Non ci sono segnali che contraddicano questa logica nel testo.
"

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Matteo ha preparato dei biscotti?","Answer: No, it is not true. Maria's statement (""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"") is a conditional sentence indicating that Matteo would prepare cookies **only if the TV were on**. Since the TV is off (as stated in the context), the condition for Matteo to prepare cookies is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Matteo prepared cookies. The truth of the statement depends solely on whether the TV was on, which it was not.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Emma si è vestita di viola?","**Answer:** No, è falso che Emma si sia vestita di viola. Secondo Maria, se il tempo fosse stato soleggiato, Emma avrebbe dovuto indossare il viola. Tuttavia, anche se il tempo era soleggiato (come afferma il contesto), Emma si è vestita di verde, non di viola. Pertanto, la premessa di Maria non è stata rispettata.

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Emma si è vestita di viola?","**Answer:** No, it is not true that Emma dressed in purple. Maria's statement (""If the weather is sunny, Emma will dress in purple"") is a conditional, meaning it only applies if the weather is sunny.

S6T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il parco giochi è vuoto. Inoltre, le strade sono tranquille. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il parco giochi è vuoto, Angelà si farà un selfie"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Angela si è fatta un selfie?","The answer is **no**. 

Maria's statement is a conditional: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie."" While the playground is indeed empty (satisfying the condition), this does not guarantee that Angela actually took a selfie. The statement only establishes a hypothetical relationship, not a factual outcome. Without explicit confirmation that Angela followed through, we cannot conclude she did.

Maria aveva detto: ""Se il parco giochi è vuoto, Angelà si farà un selfie"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Angela si è fatta un selfie?","**Answer:** No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.  
The context explicitly states that ""Angela non si è fatta un selfie"" (Angela did not take a selfie). Maria’s statement (""If the park is empty, Angelà will take a selfie"") is a conditional prediction, but the actual outcome contradicts this. Since the park is empty (*given*), Maria’s expectation would imply Angela should have taken a selfie, but the reality is she did not. Thus, the statement ""Angela took a selfie"" is false.

Maria ha dichiarato che Angela avrebbe fatto un selfie *se* il parco fosse stato vuoto. Tuttavia, il contesto specifica che il parco è *pieno*. Poiché la condizione per il selfie non si è verificata (il parco non è stato vuoto), non si può concludere che Angela abbia fatto un selfie.

No, non è necessariamente vero che Paolo abbia ricevuto 50 euro. Maria ha espresso una condizione ipotetica (""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro""), ma non c'è evidenza che questa fosse un impegno vincolante. Il semplice fatto che il prato sia stato tagliato non implica automaticamente che Maria abbia pagamento. La dichiarazione di Maria è una frase condizionale, che non garantisce un'azione reale a meno che non esista un accordo o una promessa esplicita, non menzionata nel contesto.

S7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Paolo ha ricevuto 50 euro?","**Answer:**  
No, it is not true that Paolo received 50 euros.  

**Reasoning:**  
Maria's statement establishes a conditional: *""If Paolo cuts the grass, he will receive 50 euros.""* The context confirms that Paolo did cut the grass (A is true), but he did **not** receive the money (B is false). While Maria's statement logically implies that B should follow A, the actual outcome contradicts this. Since the context explicitly states Paolo did not receive the 50 euros, the conclusion is false, regardless of Maria's statement. The key here is that the real-world outcome (B is false) overrides the implication derived from the condition.

Maria aveva eukaryotico una condizione: il pagamento dipendeva dal fatto che Paolo tagliasse il prato.

Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"".

Maria ha stabilito una condizione: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"" (se P, allora Q). Poiché il cane **non** sta giocando (P è falso), la condizione non si verifica.

Maria ha dichiarato che, in caso di frigorifero vuoto, Anna porterà le ciambelle.

Maria ha stabilito che se il frigorifero era vuoto, Anna avrebbe portato delle ciambelle. Tuttavia, il contesto afferma chiaramente che Anna non ha portato alcuna ciambella.

Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","According to María's statement (""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno""), which is a conditional assertion (P → Q), it is **true that there is pizza in the oven**.  

**Explanation**:  
- María's statement implies that whenever Juan is hungry (P), pizza must be in the oven (Q).  
- The context confirms that Juan *is* hungry (P is true).  
- For the conditional P → Q to hold, Q (pizza in the oven) must also be true.  
- Since the context explicitly states there is pizza in the oven (Q is true), María's statement is consistent with the reality described.  

Thus, **yes**, María's assertion confirms that there is pizza in the oven under the given conditions.

Según la afirmación de María, si la rueda del coche está pinchada, entonces hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.

B6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje. Tampoco hay ninguna bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Según lo que dice María, quien afirma: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"", y dado que en el contexto se confirma que la rueda está pinchada (antecedente verdadero), **la consecuencia lógica de su afirmación es que debe existir una bomba de aire en el garaje** (consecuente verdadero). 

Aunque el contexto contradice esto al indicar que **no hay bomba de aire en el garaje**, la pregunta se centra específicamente en la lógica de la afirmación de María, no en la realidad. Por lo tanto, **según su razonamiento**, sí sería cierto que hay una bomba de aire. 

**Respuesta:**  
Sí, según lo que dice María, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.

Sí, es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería.  

**Explicación:**  
María declara: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". En el contexto dado, se confirma que la planta está seca. Según su enunciado, como se cumple la condición inicial (planta seca), la consecuencia (regador en la estantería) debe ser verdadera. Además, el contexto menciona explícitamente que hay un regador en la estantería, lo que respalda la validez de la afirmación de María. Por lo tanto, en este caso, la conclusión es válida.

Dado que en el contexto se confirma que la planta está seca (P es verdadero), según su enunciado, Q (el regador en la estantería) debe ser también verdadero. 

**Respuesta:** Sí, según María, es cierto que hay un regador en la estantería. Su enunciado sigue una lógica condicional que, dadas las condiciones dadas (la planta seca), implica la presencia del regador.

María afirma una condicional: ""Si la planta está seca (P), entonces hay un regadero en la estantería (Q)"". Sin embargo, el contexto dice que **la planta no está seca** (¬P). En lógica, cuando el antecedente (P) es falso, la verdad de la afirmación condicional no excluye ni confirma la existencia de Q.

S1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","**Answer:**  
Sí, es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza. María dijo que si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza. Dado que el loro está en la jaula (como se menciona en el contexto), la condición de María se cumple. Por lo tanto, según lo que ella afirmó, Tomás sí trajo pizza. 

**Explicación:**  
La afirmación de María es una proposición condicional: *""Si A (el loro está en la jaula), entonces B (Tomás traerá pizza)*. En el contexto, A es verdadera (el loro está en la jaula), por lo que B debe ser verdadera según la lógica de su enunciado. Aunque el texto no menciona directamente que Tomás haya completado la acción, el razonamiento basado en la palabra de María implica que sí trajo pizza.

S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","**Respuesta:** No, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza. 

**Explicación:**  
María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás llevará pizza». Según la lógica de las condiciones, si el antecedente (el loro en la jaula) es verdadero, el consecuente (Tomás trae pizza) también debe ser cierto para mantener válida la afirmación. En el contexto dado, el loro está en la jaula, por lo que según María, Tomás **debería** traer pizza. Sin embargo, el texto explícitamente indica que **Tomás no trajo pizza**. Esto contradice la implicación de María, lo que significa que o su condición no se cumplió (lo cual sí se cumplió) o su afirmación no se verificó (Tomás no cumplió). 

Por lo tanto, **según los hechos reales del contexto**, la respuesta es que no es cierto que Tomás trajo pizza.

S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza».

María dijo: ""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza"" (P → Q). Dado que **el loro no está en la jaula** (¬P), la premisa de la afirmación de María no se cumple. En lógica, cuando el antecedente (P) es falso, la implicación P → Q se considera verdadera **independientemente de si Q es verdadera o falsa**. Esto significa que no se puede deducir si Tomás trajo pizza o no a partir de esta afirmación. 

Además, no hay información adicional que opere como premisa para inferir que Tomás trajo pizza. Por lo tanto, **no se puede afirmar que sea verdadero**.

S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","**Answer:** Sí, es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas. Según la condición establecida por María (""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"") y dado que la televisión está encendida, la lógica de las proposiciones condicionales exige que el resultado (Mateo haciendo galletas) se cumpla.

**Explicación:**  
María dijo: **""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas""**. Aunque la condición (la televisión está encendida) se cumple, el resultado (Mateo hizo galletas) no se ha verificado en la realidad según el contexto proporcionado.

No, no es verdad que Emma fue de morado según lo que decía María.  

**Explicación:**  
María estableció una condición: si el tiempo está soleado, Emma debe ir de morado. Aunque el contexto indica que el tiempo está soleado (cumplicando la condición), Emma fue de verde, no morado. Esto contradice lo que había predicho María. Por tanto, según su propia afirmación, no es correcto afirmar que Emma fue de morado, ya que no siguió la regla establecida.

Porque Marie estableció una condición: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"".

Dado que el contexto confirma que el parque está vacío (antecedente verdadero), lógicamente, según la estructura de la proposición de María, se espera que el consecuente (Júlia tome un selfie) sea verdadero. Sin embargo, en la realidad, cuya verdad depende de que Julia cumpliera con la acción, el contexto no menciona explícitamente que Júlia lo hizo. Por lo tanto, **no se puede afirmar con certeza que Júlia se hizo un selfie**, ya que la condición solo implica una relación lógica, no una acción garantizada. La respuesta, según el marco de María, sería **no necesariamente cierto**, ya que la afirmación de María describe una posibilidad, no una realidad comprobada.
"
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie.

María solo afirmó que Júlia se haría un selfie **si** el parque estuviera vacío.

María indicó que si Pablo cortara el césped, recibiría los 50 euros. Aunque se menciona que el césped fue cortado, no se especifica que **Pablo** fue quien realizó la acción.

S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","**Respuesta:** No, no es cierto que Pablo recibió 50 euros según lo que decía María.  

**Explicación:**  
María estableció una condición convencional: *""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros""*. Sin embargo, el contexto dando cuenta que *""el césped ha sido cortado""* no especifica que lo haya hecho Pablo. Solo se confirma que el césped fue cortado (sin indicar quién), por lo que la condición que María mencionó (*""Pablo corta el césped""*) no necesariamente se cumple. Por este motivo, no hay garantía de que Pablo recibiera el dinero.

S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Sí, es cierto que Antonio leyó un libro. Según la afirmación de María: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"", este es un condicional donde la acción del perro jugando (antecedente) implica directamente que Antonio leerá el libro (consecuente). Dado que en el contexto se menciona que el perro está jugando, se cumple la condición establecida por María, por lo tanto, Antonio debe haber leído un libro.

S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Según lo que decía María (""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro""), **es falso que Antonio leyó un libro**. 

Aunque el perro está jugando (antecedente verdadero), el contexto establece explícitamente que *Antonio no leyó ningún libro*. La afirmación de María es un condicional lógico (si P, entonces Q), pero en este caso, aunque P (perro jugando) sea verdadero, Q (Antonio leyendo un libro) **no se cumple** en la realidad dada. Por lo tanto, según María, **no se cumple el consecuente**, lo que sugiere que su afirmación podría no ser cierta en este contexto específico. 

**Respuesta:** No, no es cierto que Antonio leyó un libro, ya que María's condición no se cumplió.

S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro. María dijo que si el perro está jugando, entonces Antonio leerá un libro. Sin embargo, como el perro **no está jugando** (según el contexto), la condición de su afirmación no se cumple. Por lo tanto, no se puede deducir que Antonio haya leído un libro. La afirmación de María solo se aplica si el perro estuviera jugando, lo cual no es el caso. 

**Respuesta:** No, porque la condición de María (""si el perro está jugando"") no se haya cumplido.

Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Sí, es cierto que Ana trajo donuts. Porque según la afirmación de María, si la nevera está vacía (y en efecto lo está, según el contexto), Ana debe traer donuts. Dado que la condición se cumple, la acción de Ana (traer donuts) es obligatoria según lo indicado. Por lo tanto, la respuesta es afirmativa.

Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, no es verdad que Ana trajo donuts. Aunque María estableció una condición (""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"") y la nevera efectivamente está vacía, el hecho concreto es que Ana no trajo donuts.
