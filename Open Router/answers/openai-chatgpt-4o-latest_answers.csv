B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on what Mary says, ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven,"" and knowing from the context that John is indeed hungry, we can logically infer that there is pizza in the oven.

So, the answer is: Yes, there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven.

According to the context, John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. Mary’s statement — ""If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven"" — is therefore false, because the condition (John is hungry) is true, but the consequence (pizza in the oven) is false. So, based on both the context and Mary’s statement, we conclude that there is no pizza in the oven."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary’s statement — ""If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven"" — is a conditional statement. It does not assert that John is hungry or that there is pizza in the oven; it only tells us what would be the case if John were hungry.

Since the context tells us that John is not hungry, the condition (""John is hungry"") is false. In logic, a conditional statement with a false antecedent (""if"" part) is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (""then"" part). Therefore, the statement doesn’t provide any information about whether there is actually pizza in the oven.

So, based on what Mary says and the given context, we cannot conclude that there is pizza in the oven."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

Explanation: Mary states, ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table."" This is a conditional statement. According to the context, Nicole's head does hurt. Therefore, based on Mary's conditional statement, the condition is met, and we can conclude that there is aspirin on the table."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table.

Explanation: Mary says, ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table."" This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q), where:

- P: Nicole's head hurts (which is true according to the context).
- Q: There is aspirin on the table (which is false according to the context).

Since P is true and Q is false, Mary's conditional statement is false—it does not reflect reality. Therefore, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is aspirin on the table.

Mary's statement — ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"" — is a conditional statement. It only indicates that if the condition (Nicole's head hurting) were true, then the result (aspirin being on the table) would follow. However, we know from the context that Nicole's head does not hurt, so the condition is false.

In logic, a conditional statement (if A, then B) does not allow us to conclude anything about B when A is false. So, since Nicole's head does not hurt, we can't conclude whether or not there is aspirin on the table based on Mary's statement alone. It may or may not be there."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, it is true that there is water in the fridge.

Explanation: Mary says, ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge."" This is a conditional statement. In the context, we are told that Lucy is thirsty. Since the condition (Lucy being thirsty) is true, and the conditional statement asserts that this implies water is in the fridge, we can conclude that—according to Mary—there is indeed water in the fridge."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge.

Here's the reasoning: The context tells us that Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. Mary says, ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge."" This is a conditional statement (If P, then Q). However, in reality, P (Lucy is thirsty) is true, but Q (there is water in the fridge) is false. That means Mary's statement is actually false based on the current situation. So, we can conclude that there is no water in the fridge, as stated in the context."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on what Mary says, we cannot determine for certain whether there is water in the fridge.

Mary's statement — ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"" — is a conditional statement. It only tells us what would be true if Lucy were thirsty. Since the context states that Lucy is not thirsty, the condition is not met, and the statement doesn't tell us anything about the actual presence of water in the fridge.

So, the correct answer is: We don't know."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Explanation: Mary says, ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer."" This is a conditional statement. From the context, we know that Peter's phone is dead, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, according to Mary's statement, the conclusion—that there is a charger in the drawer—must be true."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, it is not true that there is a charger in the drawer.

Here's why: Mary says, ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer."" This is a conditional statement of the form ""If A, then B"" (A → B), where:
- A: Peter's phone is dead (which, according to the context, is true)
- B: There is a charger in the drawer (which, according to the context, is false)

For a conditional statement to be true, if the premise (A) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. However, in this case, A is true and B is false, which makes the statement ""If A, then B"" false.

Since we are told both that Peter's phone is dead and that there is no charger in the drawer, Mary's statement is false. Therefore, it is not true that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Based on what Mary says — ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"" — we cannot conclude for certain that there is a charger in the drawer.

This is a conditional statement: ""If Peter's phone is dead (P), then there is a charger in the drawer (Q)."" Symbolically, it's P → Q.

However, we are told that Peter's phone is fully charged, which means P (Peter’s phone is dead) is false. When the premise (P) is false in a conditional statement, the conditional as a whole doesn’t tell us anything about the truth of Q (whether there is a charger in the drawer or not). The statement remains logically true regardless of whether there is actually a charger in the drawer.

Therefore, we cannot determine whether the charger is in the drawer based on Mary's statement and the fact that Peter's phone is fully charged.

Final answer: We do not know."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Explanation: Mary’s statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack."" The context confirms that the weather is rainy, and we are also told directly that there is an umbrella on the coat rack. Therefore, based on both Mary's statement and the context, the presence of the umbrella on the coat rack is consistent and true."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Explanation: The context states that the weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. Mary’s statement—""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack""—is a conditional statement. However, the actual situation contradicts this statement: it is rainy, yet there is no umbrella. Therefore, based on the actual facts, Mary's statement is false, and there is indeed no umbrella on the coat rack."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not necessarily true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is conditional: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack."" Since the weather is sunny (not rainy), the condition is not met, and therefore we cannot conclude anything about the umbrella's presence. The statement does not imply that an umbrella is there when it is not rainy."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, based on what Mary says and the context that your tire is flat, it follows that there is a pump in the garage."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not true that there is a pump in the garage.

Explanation: Mary stated, ""If your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage."" This is a conditional statement. However, the context says that your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. This contradicts Mary's statement, which means her claim is false in this situation. Therefore, based on the context, it is not true that there is a pump in the garage."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is implied that there is a pump in the garage. Her statement assumes the existence of a pump there, regardless of whether the tire is actually flat."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf.

According to Mary’s statement, “If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf,” and given that the plant is indeed dry, it follows that there is a water can on the shelf. This matches the context provided."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.

Explanation: Mary says, ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf."" This is a conditional statement (""if A, then B""). However, in the context, we are told the plant is dry (A is true), but there is no water can on the shelf (B is false). This means that the conditional statement made by Mary is actually false in this situation — the condition is met, but the consequence is not. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary’s statement is false based on the facts given, and specifically, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Based on what Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf,"" this is a conditional statement in the form ""If P, then Q,"" where:

- P = the plant is dry
- Q = there is a water can on the shelf

In this case, the context states that the plant is not dry (i.e., P is false). In logic, when the premise P is false in a conditional statement, the truth of the entire conditional (""If P, then Q"") cannot be used to determine the truth of Q. That is, the statement tells us what happens if the plant is dry, but says nothing about what happens if the plant is not dry.

Therefore, based on what Mary says, we cannot determine whether there is a water can on the shelf.

Answer: We cannot determine."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes, it is true that there is an iron in the closet.

Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet."" This is a conditional statement.

In the provided context, George's shirt is indeed wrinkled. Since the condition (George's shirt is wrinkled) is true and the conditional statement is given as true, the conclusion (there is an iron in the closet) must also be true. Therefore, based on what Mary says and the context, there is an iron in the closet."
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet.

Explanation: Mary’s statement is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet."" In logic, this means that if the first part (the shirt is wrinkled) is true, then the second part (there is an iron) must also be true for the whole statement to be true.

However, from the context, we know that George's shirt is wrinkled (true), but there is no iron in the closet (false). So, the conditional statement ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet"" is actually false.

Therefore, based on the facts given, it is not true that there is an iron in the closet."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot determine for certain whether there is an iron in the closet.

Mary’s statement is: “If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet.” This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q. In this case:

P: George’s shirt is wrinkled  
Q: There is an iron in the closet  

This type of statement does not say what happens when the shirt is not wrinkled (which is the case here). Since the condition (George’s shirt is wrinkled) is false in this scenario, the conditional statement tells us nothing about whether there is actually an iron in the closet. So we cannot conclude whether the iron is there or not.

Answer: We do not know."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.

Mary's statement is: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf."" The context confirms that Susy does want to read, and this satisfies the condition (the ""if"" part) of Mary's statement. Therefore, according to Mary, the conclusion (that there are books on the shelf) must also be true."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, it is not true that there are books on the shelf.

Mary's statement is: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf."" This is a conditional (if-then) statement.

However, in the context provided, Susy does want to read, but there are no books on the shelf. This contradicts Mary’s conditional statement, which implies that if Susy wants to read, books must be present on the shelf.

Since Susy does want to read, but the books are not there, the conclusion is that the conditional Mary stated is false in this context. Therefore, based on the actual situation, there are no books on the shelf — making Mary's claim untrue."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf.

Mary’s statement “If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf” suggests that the availability of books on the shelf is not dependent on Susy’s desire to read. Rather, the conditional implies that if Susy does decide to read, those books are what she could choose. It presupposes that books are indeed on the shelf, regardless of Susy’s interest."
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Yes, pizza is more popular than pasta, as indicated by the fact that people buy it more despite its higher cost."
F1F,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pasta more popular than pizza?","No, pasta is not more popular than pizza. Although pizza is more expensive, people buy it more, suggesting that pizza is more popular."
F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","Yes, green tea is more used than black coffee, as most people prefer green tea despite black coffee being cheaper."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","No, black coffee is not more used than green tea. Although it is cheaper, most people prefer green tea, which suggests that green tea is used more frequently despite its higher cost."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","Yes, in this context, soda appears to be more in demand than water, as it mentions that although water is healthier, many people choose soda."
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","No, water is not more in demand than soda in this context. Although it is healthier, the statement indicates that many people still choose soda over water."
F4T,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context, is broccoli more popular than gnocchi?","Yes, broccoli appears to be more popular than gnocchi in this context, as it is used more often despite being more difficult to cook."
F4F,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context,  are gnocchi more popular than broccoli?","No, gnocchi are not more popular than broccoli in this context. Although broccoli is more difficult to cook, the statement says that people use it more. Therefore, broccoli is more commonly used and thus more popular than gnocchi in this context."
F5T,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, are burgers more popular than sushi?","Yes, burgers are more popular than sushi. Although sushi is considered healthier, the context states that people eat burgers more often, indicating greater popularity."
F5F,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, is sushi more popular than burgers?","No, sushi is not more popular than burgers. Although sushi is healthier, the context states that people eat burgers more often, indicating that burgers are more popular."
F6T,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are bananas more popular than kiwis?","Yes, bananas are more popular than kiwis. Despite being more expensive, they are purchased more frequently, indicating greater popularity."
F6F,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are kiwis more popular than bananas?","No, kiwis are not more popular than bananas. The context states that although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. This suggests that bananas are more popular."

F8F,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people reading books than watching TV?","No, more people are watching TV than reading books."
F9T,English,"Here's the context: Although running is better for fitness than walking, most people prefer walking. There is a runner on the track. In this context, is walking more popular than running?","Yes, walking is more popular than running."
F9F,English,"Here's the context: Although running is better for fitness than walking, most people prefer walking. There is a runner on the track. In this context, is running more popular than walking?","No, running is not more popular than walking. Although running is better for fitness, most people prefer walking."
S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","Based on what Mary says: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""

We know from the context that the parrot is in the cage.

Mary’s statement is a conditional: If A (the parrot is in the cage), then B (Thomas will bring pizza). The condition A is true.

However, this conditional only tells us what will happen if the condition is met—it does not confirm that it actually did happen. In logic, from ""If A, then B"" and ""A"", we can infer ""B"" only if we accept Mary's statement as true and reliable.

Assuming Mary is a trustworthy source and her statement is accurate, then yes, it follows that Thomas brought pizza.

Answer: Yes, Thomas brought pizza."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza.

According to Mary’s statement: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza.""  
This is a conditional statement: If A, then B.

In this case:
- A (the parrot is in the cage) is true.
- B (Thomas will bring pizza) is supposed to be true if A is true.

But the context says that Thomas did not bring pizza.  
Therefore, A is true and B is false — this means the conditional statement is false.

So, based on what Mary said, it should be true that Thomas brings pizza if the parrot is in the cage. Since that did not happen, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza.

According to Mary's statement, ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza."" This is a conditional statement, meaning Thomas bringing pizza depends on the parrot being in the cage. However, we are told that the parrot is not in the cage. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude that Thomas brought pizza. In fact, based on the statement, it is unlikely that he did."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on what Mary said — ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"" — and the fact that you did finish your broccoli, it follows that, according to her statement, Mark was supposed to give you a candy. However, this does not guarantee that he actually did give you one. 

So, based solely on Mary's statement, we cannot say with certainty that Mark gave you a candy — only that he was supposed to if Mary was telling the truth and the condition was met.

Therefore, the answer is: Not necessarily."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not necessarily true that Mark gave you a candy.

Mary said, ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy."" You finished your broccoli, so according to her statement, Mark was supposed to give you a candy. However, the actual outcome was that you did not receive a candy. This suggests that either Mark did not follow through, or Mary's statement was not accurate. Therefore, based on the information given, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No, it is not true that Mark gave you a candy.

Based on what Mary said—""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy""—receiving the candy is conditional on finishing your broccoli. Since you didn't finish your broccoli, the condition was not met, so Mark would not have given you a candy."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

Explanation: According to Mary, ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera."" The context states that the foxes are indeed dancing. Therefore, based on the conditional statement made by Mary, it follows that Susan got a camera."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

Explanation: Mary stated, ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera."" Since the context confirms that the foxes are indeed dancing, the condition in Mary's statement is met. Therefore, according to what Mary said, Susan got a camera."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No, it is not true that Susan got a camera.

According to Mary, ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera."" This is a conditional statement. Since it is stated in the context that the foxes are not dancing, the condition (""the foxes are dancing"") is false. In logic, when the condition of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the conclusion (""Susan will get a camera""). However, this does not allow us to conclude whether Susan got a camera or not—it simply means that the condition for her getting the camera was not met.

Therefore, based on the given statement and context, we cannot say that Susan got a camera."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"" — and knowing that the TV is on, we can apply logical reasoning.

Mary's statement is a conditional:  
If (TV is on), then (Matthew will bake cookies).

Since the TV is indeed on, then, according to Mary's statement, Matthew will bake cookies.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Yes, it is true that Matthew baked cookies — assuming that what Mary said is true."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.

According to Mary’s statement, “If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.” This implies that the condition of the TV being on should lead to Matthew baking cookies.

In the context provided:
- The TV is on (condition is met)
- Matthew did not bake cookies (the expected result did not occur)

Therefore, Mary’s statement is not upheld by the events. Matthew did not bake cookies despite the TV being on, which means the conditional statement is false in this case.

So, based on what Mary says, Matthew was supposed to bake cookies — but in reality, he did not. Hence, the answer is: No, Matthew did not bake cookies."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not necessarily true that Matthew baked cookies.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the TV is on, then Matthew will bake cookies."" This means that Matthew baking cookies depends on the TV being on. Since we know the TV is off, the condition for the implication is not met. In logic, when the ""if"" part (the antecedent) of a conditional statement is false, the whole conditional statement is considered true regardless of whether the ""then"" part (the consequent) happens.

Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Matthew baked cookies or not — we only know that the condition for baking cookies (the TV being on) was not met. So, based on what Mary says, we do not have enough information to say that Matthew baked cookies."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Yes, based on what Mary said (""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"") and given that the weather is sunny today, it is true that Emma wore purple."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not necessarily true that Emma wore purple.

Based on Mary’s statement (""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"") and the context provided (the weather is sunny and Emma is wearing green), we find a contradiction. According to what Mary said, sunny weather should imply Emma wears purple. However, Emma is wearing green instead. This means Mary's statement is not accurate in this situation.

Therefore, the answer is:

No, Emma did not wear purple."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not necessarily true that Emma wore purple.

Mary's statement — ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"" — is a conditional (if-then) statement. It only makes a claim about what happens when the weather is sunny. 

However, the context says that the weather is rainy and very windy, not sunny. Since the condition (sunny weather) isn't met, we cannot conclude anything definitive about whether Emma wore purple based on Mary's statement alone. 

So, the answer is: We don't know."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"" — and given that the playground is indeed empty, we would expect Angela to take a selfie if Mary's statement is true.

However, we cannot say for certain that Angela took a selfie. Mary’s statement is a conditional (""If A, then B""), and while A (the playground is empty) is true, we do not have direct evidence that B (Angela took a selfie) actually occurred. 

So, the correct answer is:

Not necessarily. We know the condition was met, but we do not have confirmation that Angela took the selfie."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not true that Angela took a selfie.

Based on what Mary said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie.""

This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q.
P: The playground is empty. (This is true.)
Q: Angela will take a selfie. (But this is false.)

So we have a case where the condition (playground is empty) is true, but the result (Angela takes a selfie) is false. That makes the conditional statement false, meaning Mary's statement did not hold.

Therefore, based on the actual outcome (Angela did not take a selfie), it is not true that Angela took a selfie."
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","No, it is not necessarily true that Angela took a selfie.

Mary said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie."" This is a conditional statement — it only tells us what happens if the playground is empty.

However, the context tells us that the playground is crowded, which is the opposite of being empty. That means the condition for Angela taking a selfie was not met. Since the condition wasn't met, Mary's statement doesn't provide any information about whether Angela took a selfie or not in this case.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Angela took a selfie based on what Mary said."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based on what Mary says, we cannot say for certain that Paul got 50 euros. While the lawn has been mowed, the statement from Mary—""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros""—only establishes a conditional: Paul gets the money if he is the one who mowed the lawn. The context confirms the lawn was mowed but does not specify who did it. Therefore, unless we know that Paul was the one who mowed the lawn, we cannot conclude that he received the 50 euros."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.

Mary said, ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros."" Although the lawn has been mowed, the context tells us that Paul did not get 50 euros. This suggests that Paul was not the one who mowed the lawn. Therefore, based on Mary's statement and the given information, Paul did not meet the condition required to receive the 50 euros."
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros. Based on the context, the lawn has not been mowed. Mary stated that Paul would get 50 euros if he mows the lawn. Since the condition (mowing the lawn) has not been met, Paul did not receive the 50 euros."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that Anthony read a book. Mary stated, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book."" Since we are told that the dog is playing, the condition of the statement is fulfilled, so the conclusion—that Anthony will read a book—must also be true."
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not true that Anthony read a book.

Mary said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book.""  
This is a conditional statement: If A (the dog is playing), then B (Anthony will read a book).

From the context:
- The dog is playing (A is true).
- Anthony did not read a book (B is false).

Since the condition was met (A is true), but the result did not happen (B is false), this means Mary’s statement is false in this situation.

Therefore, based on the facts given, Anthony did not read a book."
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No, it is not necessarily true that Anthony read a book.

Based on Mary’s statement, ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book,"" this is a conditional statement. It only tells us what happens if the dog is playing. In our context, the dog is not playing, so the condition is not met. That means the statement doesn't provide any information about what happens if the dog is not playing—it could be that Anthony reads or does not read a book in that case. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Anthony read a book or not."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Yes, based on what Mary said, if the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts. Since the context confirms that the fridge is empty, it follows that Amy brought donuts."
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No, it is not true that Amy brought donuts.

Based on Mary’s statement, “If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts,” and given that the fridge is empty but Amy did not bring donuts, the outcome contradicts Mary’s statement. Therefore, the statement made by Mary is not upheld in this situation, and it is true that Amy did not bring donuts."
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Based on what Mary said — ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"" — and the context that the fridge is full, we can conclude the following:

Mary's statement is a conditional:  
If (fridge is empty), then (Amy will bring donuts).

This type of statement does not imply anything about what happens if the fridge is not empty (i.e., if it is full). Since the fridge is full, the condition (""fridge is empty"") is false. In logic, when the ""if"" part of an ""if-then"" statement is false, the entire statement is considered vacuously true, but we cannot infer whether the ""then"" part (Amy bringing donuts) actually occurred.

Therefore, based on what Mary said, and the fact that the fridge is full, we cannot conclude that Amy brought donuts.  

Answer: No, it is not necessarily true that Amy brought donuts."
B1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i hi ha pizza al forn. També hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","Segons el que diu la Maria, ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Això és una oració condicional: si la primera part (en Joan té gana) és certa, llavors la segona part (hi ha pizza al forn) també ha de ser certa.

En el context, sabem que:
- En Joan té gana (això s'afirma com a fet).
- Hi ha pizza al forn (també s'afirma com a fet en el context).

Per tant, tenint en compte tant el context com la condició expressada per la Maria, sí, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn."
B1F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan té gana i no hi ha pizza al forn. Tampoc no hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No, no és veritat que hi hagi pizza al forn.

Segons la Maria, “Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn”. Això és una frase condicional (“Si A, llavors B”):  
- A: En Joan té gana.  
- B: Hi ha pizza al forn.

Del context sabem que:  
- En Joan té gana (A és certa).  
- No hi ha pizza al forn (B és falsa).

Això significa que la condicional (“Si A, llavors B”) que diu la Maria és falsa en aquest cas. Per tant, en Joan té gana però no hi ha pizza al forn, i la frase de la Maria és incorrecta.

Així doncs, la resposta és: No, no hi ha pizza al forn."
B1C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: En Joan no té gana. Hi ha pasta a la nevera. La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha pizza al forn?","No.

Explicació: La Maria diu: ""Si en Joan té gana, hi ha pizza al forn"". Aquesta és una proposició condicional (""Si A, llavors B""). Tanmateix, en el context sabem que en Joan no té gana. Això vol dir que la condició (A) no es compleix. En lògica, si la condició d'una frase condicional és falsa, no podem concloure si la conseqüència (el que passa després de ""llavors"") és certa o no. Per tant, no podem afirmar que hi ha pizza al forn, només sabem que la condició per a què n’hi hagi (que en Joan tingui gana) no es compleix.

Per tant, el que diu la Maria no és cert en aquest cas, ja que la condició (""la Núria té mal de cap"") es compleix, però la conseqüència (""hi ha aspirines sobre la taula"") no. Així que, efectivament, no hi ha aspirines sobre la taula."

Per tant, no podem saber amb certesa si hi ha o no una regadora a la prestatgeria."

B8C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La camisa del Jordi no té arrugues. Hi ha una taula de planxar al balcó. La Maria diu: ""Si la camisa del jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una planxa a l'armari?","Segons la frase de la Maria: ""Si la camisa del Jordi està arrugada, hi ha una planxa a l'armari"", ella fa una afirmació condicional. Aquesta mena d'afirmació només es compleix si la condició (""la camisa del Jordi està arrugada"") és certa.

Però, segons el context, la camisa del Jordi no té arrugues. Per tant, la condició no es compleix. En lògica, si una condició és falsa, la frase condicional sencera (""Si..., llavors..."") pot ser considerada veritable sense que això impliqui que la conclusió (""hi ha una planxa a l'armari"") sigui certa.

A més, al context es diu que hi ha una taula de planxar al balcó, però no es menciona si hi ha una planxa a l'armari.

Del context sabem que la Susanna vol llegir i que no hi ha llibres a l'estanteria. Això fa que la condicional que diu la Maria sigui falsa, perquè s'ha complert la condició (la Susanna vol llegir), però no es compleix la conseqüència (no hi ha llibres).

Aleshores, segons la condició que ha dit la Maria, això implica que el Tomàs portarà pizza.

Sabem pel context que:

- El Tomàs no ha portat pizza (la conseqüència no es compleix).

Per tant, la condicional que diu la Maria no s'ha complert: la condició s'ha donat, però la conseqüència no. Això vol dir que la frase de la Maria és falsa en aquest cas. I clarament, el Tomàs no ha portat pizza."

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, s’espera que el Marc t’hagi donat un caramel, però no podem afirmar amb certesa que ho hagi fet, ja que només tenim una condicional i no una confirmació de l’acció.

Resposta: No ho sabem del cert, però segons el que diu la Maria, hauria d’haver-te'l donat."

Explicació: La Maria va dir que ""Si les guineus estan ballant, La Júlia rebrà una càmera fotogràfica"". Com que el context confirma que les guineus estan ballant, llavors, segons el que diu la Maria, es compleix la condició perquè la Júlia rebi una càmera fotogràfica.

El context ens diu que les guineus estan ballant (A és cert), però també ens diu que la Júlia no ha rebut cap càmera fotogràfica (B és fals). Per tant, l'afirmació que la Maria va fer (A → B) resulta ser falsa, ja que s'ha donat A però no s'ha donat B.

A (antecedent): Les guineus estan ballant  
B (conseqüent): La Júlia rep una càmera fotogràfica

Perquè B sigui veritat en base a aquesta proposició, A ha de ser veritat. Però segons el context, sabem que les guineus no estan ballant (A és falsa). Quan l'antecedent és fals, la proposició condicional no ens dona cap informació sobre si el consegüent és cert o fals. Tanmateix, la pregunta és si Júlia ha rebut la càmera fotogràfica, i segons la informació que tenim (i com que la condició per rebre-la no s’ha complert), la resposta és que no, la Júlia no l’ha rebuda."
S4T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La televisió està engegada. La ràdio també està engegada. La Maria havia dit: ""Si la televisió està engegada, el Mateu farà galetes"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Mateu ha fet galetes?","Segons el que diu la Maria, ""Si la televisió està engegada, el Mateu farà galetes"". Sabem pel context que la televisió està engegada. Per tant, segons la condició que ha expressat la Maria, això implica que el Mateu farà galetes.

Tanmateix, la frase de la Maria no diu que ""el Mateu ha fet galetes"" sinó que ""el Mateu farà galetes"", és a dir, fa una predicció o estableix una conseqüència futura basada en una condició. No se’ns informa explícitament si les galetes ja han estat fetes o no, només que, si es compleix la condició (i es compleix, perquè la televisió està engegada), llavors, segons la Maria, el Mateu farà galetes.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, podem concloure que el Mateu farà galetes, però no podem afirmar amb certesa que ja les hagi fet.

- A (la televisió està engegada): Sí, és cert segons el context.
- B (el Mateu farà galetes): No, el context diu que no les ha fet.

Per tant, la condició que va expressar la Maria no s'ha complert. El primer enunciat (A) és cert, però el segon (B) és fals, cosa que fa que tota la proposició condicional sigui falsa. Així, segons la Maria, el Mateu hauria d'haver fet galetes, però el context diu que no les ha fet. Això implica que la seva afirmació no s'ha complert i, per tant, no és veritat que el Mateu hagi fet galetes."

Però en el context s’indica que avui fa mal temps: plou i fa vent. Per tant, no és un dia assolellat.

Com que la condició no es compleix (el temps no és assolellat), no podem concloure que l’Emma vagi de morat. De fet, segons la frase de la Maria, el fet que no sigui assolellat vol dir que no sabem (o no podem afirmar) que l’Emma vagi de morat.

Això vol dir que la proposició de la Maria (""Si el parc infantil està buit, l'Alba es farà una selfie"") és falsa sota aquest context específic, ja que s'ha donat la condició inicial (el parc buit), però no la conseqüent (fer-se una selfie).

Tanmateix, el context ens diu que ""El parc infantil està ple de gent"", per tant, la condició no es compleix. Així doncs, segons el que diu la Maria, l'Alba no s'hauria fet una selfie."
S7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","No necessàriament. El fet que la gespa hagi estat tallada no implica automàticament que en Pau l'hagi tallada. Encara que la Maria havia dit que si en Pau tallava la gespa, rebria 50 euros, no tenim informació que confirmi que fos ell qui ho fes. Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, només rebrà els 50 euros si ell és qui ha tallat la gespa, i això no es pot assegurar amb la informació donada."

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros?","No, no és veritat que el Pau hagi rebut 50 euros.

Segons el que diu la Maria, ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"". Aquesta és una condició: per tal que el Pau rebi els 50 euros, cal que ell sigui qui talli la gespa.

Tanmateix, en el context només s'indica que la gespa ha estat tallada, però no s'especifica qui ho ha fet. A més, es diu explícitament que el Pau no ha rebut els 50 euros. Això pot indicar que, tot i que la gespa ha estat tallada, possiblement no ho ha fet el Pau i, per tant, la condició no s'ha complert.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, si el Pau no ha tallat la gespa, llavors no ha de rebre els 50 euros, i com que el Pau no els ha rebut, això seria coherent amb la condició que ha expressat la Maria."
S7C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa no ha estat tallada. Les flors tampoc no han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"".

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Antoni ha llegit un llibre?","Sí, segons el que diu la Maria, si el gos està jugant, aleshores l'Antoni llegirà un llibre. Com que el context indica que el gos està jugant, podem deduir que l'afirmació condicional de la Maria s'ha complert, i per tant, l'Antoni ha llegit (o llegirà) un llibre."

Segons el que diu la Maria: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre"". Això és una proposició condicional: si es compleix la primera part (el gos està jugant), llavors s'ha de complir la segona part (l'Antoni llegirà un llibre).

Del context sabem que:
- El gos està jugant (per tant, la condició inicial s'ha complert).
- Però també sabem que l'Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre (la conclusió no s'ha complert).

Això vol dir que la condició que va dir la Maria no s'ha complert en la realitat.

Tanmateix, segons el context, el gos no està jugant. Quan la condició (el gos juga) no es compleix, no podem concloure res sobre si l'Antoni ha llegit o no un llibre. Podria haver-ho fet o no, però segons la frase de la Maria, no podem afirmar que ho hagi fet.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria, no és veritat (ni tampoc necessàriament fals) que l'Antoni hagi llegit un llibre. Simplement, no ho podem saber."
S9T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La nevera està buida. A més, el forn està espatllat. La Maria havia dit: ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que l'Anna ha portat donuts?","Segons el que diu la Maria, ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts"".

Ara bé, sabem que:
- La nevera està buida (és veritat la condició inicial).
- Però també sabem que l'Anna no ha portat donuts.

Això significa que la conseqüència no s'ha complert, tot i que la condició sí. Per tant, l'afirmació de la Maria ha resultat ser falsa en aquest cas. Així doncs, no és veritat que l'Anna hagi portat donuts; de fet, és fals."

Segons el que va dir la Maria: ""Si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts."" Aquesta frase expressa una condició: només si la nevera està buida, l'Anna portarà donuts.

Tanmateix, el context indica que ""la nevera està plena"", per tant, la condició no s'ha complert. En aquest cas, la frase no ens diu res sobre què passa si la nevera està plena; per tant, no podem concloure que l'Anna hagi portat donuts, i en tot cas, segons la lògica de la frase de la Maria, no hauria de portar-ne.

Conclusió: No, l'Anna no ha portat donuts."
B1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni ha fame e c'è della pizza in forno. C'è anche della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No, non è necessariamente vero che c'è della pizza in forno.

La frase di Maria — ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"" — è una proposizione condizionale. Significa che, secondo lei, ogni volta che Gianni ha fame, allora c'è della pizza in forno. Tuttavia, da sola, questa frase non afferma con certezza che Gianni ha fame, né che effettivamente c'è della pizza in forno in questo momento.

Per concludere che c'è davvero della pizza in forno, dovremmo sapere con certezza che Gianni ha fame. Solo allora, secondo il ragionamento di Maria, potremmo dedurre la presenza della pizza in forno. Ma la frase non afferma il fatto iniziale (cioè che Gianni ha fame), quindi non possiamo concludere che la pizza ci sia davvero."
B1F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni ha fame e non c'è della pizza in forno. Non c'è nemmeno della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No, non è vero che c'è della pizza in forno.

Spiegazione: Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". Questa è un’affermazione condizionale (“se… allora…”). Tuttavia, dal contesto sappiamo che Gianni ha fame, ma non c’è della pizza in forno. Quindi l'affermazione di Maria risulta falsa, e in particolare, questo conferma che non c’è della pizza in forno."

Spiegazione: La frase di Maria è una proposizione condizionale: ""Se Gianni ha fame, allora c'è della pizza in forno"". Tuttavia, sappiamo dal contesto che Gianni non ha fame.

B2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo. C'è anche dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","No, non è necessariamente vero.

La frase di Maria — ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"" — è una proposizione ipotetica (una condizionale). Essa afferma che la presenza di mal di testa da parte di Nicoletta implica la presenza di aspirine sul tavolo.

Tuttavia, dal punto di vista logico, questa frase non afferma direttamente che Nicoletta ha mal di testa, né che ci sono effettivamente aspirine sul tavolo. Esprime solo una relazione tra le due condizioni.

In questo caso, nel contesto è effettivamente detto che Nicoletta ha mal di testa, quindi — se diamo per vera l'affermazione di Maria — dovrebbe seguirne che ci sono aspirine sul tavolo.

Quindi, assumendo che ciò che dice Maria sia vero e che Nicoletta abbia davvero mal di testa, allora sì, deve essere vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo.

Risposta finale: Sì, se quello che dice Maria è vero e Nicoletta ha mal di testa, allora ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo."
B2F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo. Non c'è nemmeno dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto.

Spiegazione: Maria afferma: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo."" Questo è un enunciato condizionale (""se... allora...""). Tuttavia, nel contesto sappiamo che:

- Nicoletta ha mal di testa (quindi la premessa è vera),
- Ma non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo (quindi la conclusione è falsa).

Di conseguenza, il condizionale affermato da Maria risulta falso nel contesto descritto. Quindi possiamo dire con certezza, in base al contesto, che non è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo."

Spiegazione: Dal contesto sappiamo che Lucia ha sete. Maria afferma: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale (""Se A, allora B"").

Spiegazione: Il contesto ci dice chiaramente che Lucia ha sete e che non c'è dell'acqua in frigo. Tuttavia, Maria afferma: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"", il che si rivela essere una frase falsa, dato che la condizione iniziale (Lucia ha sete) è vera ma la conseguenza (c'è dell'acqua in frigo) è falsa.

Risposta: Non si può sapere. L’affermazione di Maria non offre informazioni sulla presenza dell’acqua in frigo nel caso in cui Lucia non abbia sete."

Spiegazione: Maria afferma ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli."" Questo è un'affermazione condizionale (""Se A, allora B""). Il contesto dice che il tempo è piovoso (quindi A è vera), quindi secondo la condizione data da Maria, deve anche essere vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli (B è vera). Quindi la risposta è sì."
B5F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. Non c'è nemmeno un impermeabile in macchina.

Motivazione: La frase di Maria (""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"") è una proposizione condizionale. Dal contesto sappiamo che la gomma della macchina è effettivamente a terra.

Tuttavia, dal contesto sappiamo che la gomma è a terra ma non c'è nessuna pompa in garage. Quindi, il fatto che la condizione (""gomma a terra"") sia vera e la conseguenza (""c'è una pompa in garage"") sia falsa, rende falsa anche l’affermazione di Maria.

Spiegazione: Secondo quanto detto da Maria, ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale (se... allora...). Dal contesto sappiamo che il pappagallo è nella gabbia. Quindi, dato che la condizione iniziale è vera, anche la conseguenza (""Tommaso porterà la pizza"") deve essere vera secondo l'affermazione di Maria."

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza."" Questa è un'affermazione condizionale del tipo ""Se A, allora B"".

Nel contesto, si dice che ""Il pappagallo è nella gabbia"" (quindi A è vera) e ""Tommaso non ha portato la pizza"" (quindi B è falsa).

Quindi l'affermazione condizionale fatta da Maria risulta falsa nel contesto dato, perché la condizione iniziale (il pappagallo è nella gabbia) è soddisfatta, ma la conseguenza (Tommaso porterà la pizza) non si è verificata.

Pertanto, possiamo concludere che Tommaso non ha portato la pizza."
S1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo non è nella gabbia. Neanche il cane è nella cuccia. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","No, non è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza.

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza."" Questa è una proposizione condizionale del tipo ""Se A, allora B"", dove:
- A = ""Il pappagallo è nella gabbia""
- B = ""Tommaso porterà la pizza""

Nel contesto ci viene detto che il pappagallo NON è nella gabbia. Quindi la condizione (A) non si verifica. In logica, se A è falsa, l'implicazione ""Se A, allora B"" non ci dà informazioni certe su B (cioè, può essere vera o falsa indipendentemente). Tuttavia, siccome l’unica condizione per cui Tommaso avrebbe portato la pizza è se il pappagallo fosse nella gabbia, e poiché il pappagallo non è nella gabbia, possiamo concludere che Tommaso non ha motivo, secondo l'enunciato, per portare la pizza.

Quindi, in base a quello che dice Maria, la risposta è:

No, Tommaso non ha portato la pizza."

Tuttavia, la frase non specifica se Marco effettivamente l’abbia già fatta o meno. Dice solo cosa dovrebbe accadere (""ti darà una caramella""), non cosa è successo.

Quindi, la risposta è: Non si può dire con certezza se Marco ti ha dato una caramella; possiamo solo dire che, secondo quanto detto da Maria, avrebbe dovuto farlo."

Secondo quanto detto da Maria: ""Se finisci i broccoli, Marco ti darà una caramella"". Hai finito i broccoli, quindi secondo questa affermazione, avresti dovuto ricevere una caramella.

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica"". Dal contesto sappiamo che le volpi stanno effettivamente ballando.

Nel contesto leggiamo che le volpi stanno effettivamente ballando, ma Susanna non ha ricevuto nessuna macchina fotografica. Questo significa che la condizione è soddisfatta (le volpi stanno ballando), ma la conseguenza non si verifica (Susanna non ha ricevuto la macchina fotografica), quindi l'affermazione di Maria risulta falsa.

S4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La TV è accesa. Anche la radio è accesa. Maria aveva detto: ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Matteo ha preparato dei biscotti?","In base a quello che dice Maria, ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"".

La frase è una proposizione condizionale del tipo ""Se A, allora B"", dove:
- A: la TV è accesa
- B: Matteo preparerà dei biscotti

Nel contesto, sappiamo che la TV è accesa. Quindi la condizione A si è realizzata.

Secondo la frase di Maria, se A è vera, allora B deve verificarsi.

Perciò, basandoci su ciò che dice Maria, possiamo concludere che:
Sì, è vero che Matteo ha preparato dei biscotti (o, almeno, secondo l'affermazione di Maria, dovrebbe averlo fatto)."
S4F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La TV è accesa. Anche la radio è accesa. Matteo non ha preparato i biscotti. Maria aveva detto: ""Se la TV è accesa, Matteo preparerà dei biscotti"".

- A: la TV è accesa (vera, secondo il contesto)
- B: Matteo preparerà dei biscotti (falsa, perché non lo ha fatto)

Quando la condizione (A) è vera e la conseguenza (B) è falsa, la proposizione condizionale intera risulta falsa. Quindi, dato che la TV è effettivamente accesa ma Matteo non ha preparato dei biscotti, l'enunciato di Maria si è rivelato falso in questo caso.

Pertanto, la risposta è: No, Matteo non ha preparato dei biscotti."

Motivazione: Maria aveva detto: ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola"". Poiché il contesto afferma che oggi il tempo è soleggiato, allora, secondo l'affermazione di Maria, Emma si vestirà di viola. Quindi, possiamo concludere che Emma si è vestita di viola."

Secondo Maria, ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, allora Emma si vestirà di viola"". Oggi il tempo è effettivamente soleggiato, tuttavia si osserva che Emma si è vestita di verde.

S5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Oggi il tempo è piovoso. Inoltre, c'è molto vento. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Emma si è vestita di viola?","No, non è vero che Emma si è vestita di viola.

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto che ""Se il tempo è soleggiato, Emma si vestirà di viola"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale (""Se A, allora B""), dove A è ""il tempo è soleggiato"" e B è ""Emma si vestirà di viola"".

Nel contesto attuale, però, il tempo è piovoso e c'è molto vento, quindi A (il tempo è soleggiato) è falso. Quando la condizione iniziale (premessa) è falsa, la proposizione condizionale nel suo insieme non può essere usata per trarre conclusioni certe su B (se Emma si vestirà di viola oppure no).

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Angela si è fatta un selfie?","No, non è vero che Angela si è fatta un selfie.

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto: ""Se il parco giochi è vuoto, Angela si farà un selfie"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale (""Se A, allora B""), dove A è ""il parco giochi è vuoto"" e B è ""Angela si farà un selfie"".

Nel contesto, sappiamo che:
- Il parco giochi è vuoto → A è vera.
- Angela non si è fatta un selfie → B è falsa.

Se A è vera e B è falsa, allora la proposizione ""Se A, allora B"" risulta falsa. Ciò significa che quello che ha detto Maria non è vero. Tuttavia, il fatto che la dichiarazione di Maria sia falsa non cambia i fatti: sappiamo con certezza che Angela non si è fatta un selfie.

Quindi, alla domanda: ""È vero che Angela si è fatta un selfie?"", la risposta è: No."

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto che ""Se il parco giochi è vuoto, Angela si farà un selfie"". Questo è un'implicazione logica: solo se il parco è vuoto, allora Angela si farà un selfie. Tuttavia, nel contesto è detto che ""il parco giochi è pieno"", quindi la condizione per il selfie (che il parco sia vuoto) non è soddisfatta. Pertanto, non possiamo concludere che Angela si sia fatta un selfie; anzi, in base alla frase di Maria, è logico dedurre che non lo abbia fatto."

Tuttavia, l'informazione cruciale che manca è: è stato Paolo a tagliare il prato?

Il testo non specifica chi ha effettivamente tagliato il prato. Quindi, anche se la condizione della frase (""Se Paolo taglia il prato"") è chiara, non possiamo concludere con certezza che Paolo abbia effettivamente svolto quell’azione.

Risposta: Non si può dire con certezza sulla base delle informazioni fornite."
S7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il prato è stato tagliato. Inoltre, i fiori sono stati annaffiati. Paolo non ha ricevuto 50 euro. Maria aveva detto: ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"".

Secondo quanto detto da Maria — ""Se Paolo taglia il prato, riceverà 50 euro"" — la ricezione dei 50 euro è condizionata dal fatto che Paolo tagli il prato.

Secondo il contesto, il prato non è stato tagliato. Maria aveva detto che Paolo avrebbe ricevuto 50 euro solo se avesse tagliato il prato. Poiché il prato non è stato tagliato, la condizione per ricevere i 50 euro non è stata soddisfatta. Pertanto, Paolo non ha ricevuto i 50 euro."

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","Sì, secondo quanto detto da Maria, Antonio ha letto un libro.

Spiegazione:
Maria ha detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale del tipo ""Se A, allora B"".

Dal contesto sappiamo che il cane sta effettivamente giocando (quindi A è vera). Pertanto, secondo la frase di Maria, anche la conseguenza (B) deve essere vera: Antonio leggerà un libro. Poiché il contesto è al presente e la frase di Maria implica un rapporto attuale o inevitabile tra le due condizioni, possiamo concludere che Antonio ha letto (o sta leggendo) un libro."
S8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto si sta arrampicando sull'albero. Antonio non ha letto nessun libro.

Secondo quanto ha detto Maria, ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". Questa è una proposizione condizionale: se la condizione (il cane sta giocando) è vera, allora anche la conseguenza (Antonio leggerà un libro) dovrebbe essere vera perché Maria lo ha dichiarato.

Nel contesto però si afferma chiaramente che ""Antonio non ha letto nessun libro"", mentre ""il cane sta giocando"".

Quindi la condizione si è verificata (il cane gioca), ma la conseguenza no (Antonio non ha letto un libro). Questo significa che l'affermazione fatta da Maria risulta falsa.

In ogni caso, per rispondere direttamente alla domanda: Antonio ha letto un libro? No, non lo ha fatto."

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, allora Antonio leggerà un libro."" Questa è una proposizione condizionale (""Se A, allora B""). Tuttavia, nel contesto è specificato che il cane non sta giocando. Quando la condizione (""il cane sta giocando"") non si verifica, la proposizione condizionale non fornisce alcuna informazione certa sull'esito (""Antonio leggerà un libro"" o meno). Quindi, non possiamo concludere se Antonio abbia letto un libro o no basandoci solo sulla frase di Maria e sul fatto che il cane non stava giocando. Pertanto, la risposta corretta è:

Non si può determinare se Antonio ha letto un libro."
S9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","Sulla base di quanto ha detto Maria: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"", e dato che il frigorifero è effettivamente vuoto, allora, secondo l'affermazione di Maria, Anna avrebbe dovuto portare delle ciambelle.

Tuttavia, l'affermazione è una condizionale (""Se A, allora B"") – esprime ciò che dovrebbe accadere data una certa condizione, ma non conferma direttamente che l'evento B sia realmente avvenuto. Non abbiamo un'informazione diretta che conferma che Anna abbia effettivamente portato le ciambelle.

Quindi, la risposta corretta è:

Non possiamo saperlo con certezza. Sappiamo solo che, secondo Maria, se il frigorifero è vuoto (come lo è), allora Anna dovrebbe portare delle ciambelle. Ma dal contesto non risulta se ciò sia effettivamente accaduto."
S9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle.

B = Anna porterà delle ciambelle → secondo Maria, questo dovrebbe avvenire se A è vero.

Tuttavia, il contesto ci dice esplicitamente che Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle.

Quindi, ciò che Maria aveva detto (“se il frigorifero è vuoto, allora Anna porterà delle ciambelle”) si è rivelato falso. Dato che il frigorifero è vuoto e Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle, la risposta alla domanda è:

No, Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle."

Spiegazione: Maria ha detto che ""se il frigorifero è vuoto, allora Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". Questa è una tipica proposizione condizionale (""se... allora..."").

Tuttavia, nel contesto si afferma che il frigorifero è pieno. Questo significa che la condizione (""il frigorifero è vuoto"") non si è verificata. Quando la condizione di una proposizione condizionale è falsa (cioè il frigorifero non è vuoto), non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione certa riguardo alla conseguenza (cioè se Anna abbia portato o meno delle ciambelle).

B2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","Sí, es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Explicación: María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Esta es una proposición condicional del tipo ""Si P, entonces Q"", donde P es ""a Noelia le duele la cabeza"" y Q es ""hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Dado que sabemos por el contexto que a Noelia le duele la cabeza (P es verdadera), y partiendo de que la afirmación de María es cierta, entonces debe cumplirse también Q: hay aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no es verdad que haya aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Explicación: María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Esta es una proposición condicional (""Si P, entonces Q""). Según el contexto, Noelia sí tiene dolor de cabeza (P es verdadero), pero no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa (Q es falso). En lógica, si P es verdadero y Q es falso, entonces la proposición ""Si P, entonces Q"" es falsa. Por lo tanto, lo que dice María no se cumple, y sabemos que efectivamente no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no es necesariamente verdad que haya aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Según María, ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Esta es una oración condicional (""si... entonces..."") que solo nos dice qué sucede en caso de que a Noelia le duela la cabeza. 

Sin embargo, el contexto nos dice claramente que a Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Por lo tanto, la condición no se cumple, y no podemos concluir si hay o no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. La afirmación condicional no garantiza que haya aspirinas si la condición no se da. 

Respuesta: No se puede afirmar que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y hay agua en la nevera. También hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, es verdad que hay agua en la nevera.

Explicación: María dice ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Esta es una afirmación condicional. Según el contexto, Lucía tiene sed, por lo tanto, de acuerdo con la afirmación de María, se cumple la condición para que haya agua en la nevera. Además, el contexto también confirma directamente que hay agua en la nevera. Así que sí, es verdad que hay agua en la nevera."
B3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. Tampoco hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","No, no es verdad que haya agua en la nevera.

Explicación: Según el contexto, Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"", pero esta afirmación resulta ser falsa, ya que Lucía sí tiene sed y sin embargo no hay agua en la nevera. Por lo tanto, lo que dice María no es cierto en esta situación."
B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, según lo que dice María, si Lucía tiene sed, entonces hay agua en la nevera.

B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","Sí, es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón.

Explicación: María dice ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según el contexto, el móvil de Pedro efectivamente se ha quedado sin batería. Por lo tanto, se cumple la condición del ""si"", y según lo que afirma María, también se cumple la consecuencia: hay un cargador en el cajón."
B4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y no hay ningún cargador en el cajón. Tampoco hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No, no es verdad que haya un cargador en el cajón.

Explicación: María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Esta es una afirmación condicional (si A, entonces B). El contexto indica que el móvil de Pedro sí se ha quedado sin batería (A), pero también dice claramente que no hay ningún cargador en el cajón (no B). Esto contradice la afirmación de María, lo que significa que lo que dijo no es cierto en este caso. Por lo tanto, no hay un cargador en el cajón."
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No necesariamente.  

María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Esta es una afirmación condicional (una proposición del tipo “si… entonces…”). Sin embargo, en el contexto se afirma que el móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena, por lo tanto, la condición (""el móvil se ha quedado sin batería"") no se cumple.

En lógica, una afirmación condicional no permite concluir que la parte posterior (""hay un cargador en el cajón"") sea verdadera si la condición (""el móvil se ha quedado sin batería"") no ocurre.

Por ello, con la información dada, no se puede concluir con certeza si hay un cargador en el cajón o no."
B5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y hay un paraguas en el paragüero. También hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","Sí, es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero.

Explicación: María dice que ""si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Esta es una afirmación condicional (si A, entonces B). En el contexto se indica que el tiempo está lluvioso, lo cual activa la condición. Además, el contexto también confirma que hay un paraguas en el paragüero, por lo tanto, la afirmación de María es verdadera en este caso."
B5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y no hay paraguas en el paragüero. Tampoco hay ningún chubasquero en el coche.

Explicación: María dice ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Esta es una afirmación condicional del tipo ""Si A, entonces B"". En lógica, esta afirmación solo se considera falsa si A es verdadera y B es falsa.

En el contexto dado, el tiempo está lluvioso (A es verdadera) y no hay un paraguas en el paragüero (B es falsa), por lo tanto, la afirmación de María es falsa y, efectivamente, no hay un paraguas en el paragüero."
B5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está despejado. Hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","Según lo que dice María, ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Esta es una afirmación condicional: solo dice lo que ocurre si llueve, pero no afirma nada sobre lo que sucede si no llueve.

Dado que el contexto indica que el tiempo está despejado (es decir, no está lluvioso), la condición de la afirmación no se cumple. Por lo tanto, no se puede determinar con certeza si hay o no un paraguas en el paragüero, ya que la afirmación de María no proporciona información sobre situaciones en las que no llueve.

Respuesta: No se puede saber."
B6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. También hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Sí, es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.

Explicación: María dice ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"", y el contexto confirma que la rueda del coche está pinchada. Dado que la condición se cumple (la rueda está pinchada), según lo que dice María, entonces debe cumplirse la consecuencia: hay una bomba de aire en el garaje."
B6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje. Tampoco hay ninguna bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","No, no es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje.

Explicación: María dice ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"", lo cual es una afirmación condicional. Sin embargo, el contexto indica que la rueda del coche está pinchada y no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje. Esto significa que la afirmación de María es falsa, ya que el antecedente (""la rueda está pinchada"") es verdadero, pero el consecuente (""hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"") es falso. Por tanto, según el contexto, no hay bomba de aire en el garaje."
B6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está inflada. Hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada.

Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Según lo que dice María, ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Esta es una condicional que establece una condición para que haya una bomba de aire: que la rueda esté pinchada. Sin embargo, el contexto establece que la rueda del coche está inflada, por lo tanto la condición no se cumple.

Como la condición (que la rueda esté pinchada) no se da, no se puede concluir con certeza si hay una bomba de aire en el garaje o no. La afirmación de María no dice que solo haya una bomba si la rueda está pinchada, solo que si lo está, entonces hay una bomba.

B7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y hay un regador en la estantería. También hay una manguera en el jardín.

Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","Sí, según lo que dice María, si la planta está seca, entonces hay un regador en la estantería.

Según lo que dice María: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Esta es una proposición condicional (""si… entonces…""). Sin embargo, en el contexto se nos dice que la planta está seca y que no hay ningún regador en la estantería. Esto significa que la condición (la planta está seca) se cumple, pero la consecuencia (hay un regador en la estantería) no.

Eso contradice lo que dice María, lo que implica que su afirmación es falsa en este caso. Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María y el contexto dado, no es verdad que haya un regador en la estantería."

Esta es una proposición condicional (si A, entonces B), donde:

- A: la planta está seca  
- B: hay un regador en la estantería

En el contexto sabemos que la planta no está seca. Es decir, A es falso.

En lógica, cuando una proposición condicional ""Si A, entonces B"" tiene un antecedente falso (A es falso), la proposición no nos da información sobre B. En otras palabras, no se puede concluir si B es verdadero o falso solo con la condición dada y sabiendo que A es falso.

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María, no se puede determinar si hay un regador en la estantería.

B8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está arrugada y hay una plancha en el armario. También hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón.

Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","Sí, es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario.

Explicación: María dice ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Este es un enunciado condicional. Como el contexto confirma que la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, se cumple la condición inicial de la afirmación de María. Por lo tanto, según esa afirmación, también se cumple la conclusión: hay una plancha en el armario. Además, el contexto explícitamente menciona que hay una plancha en el armario, lo que confirma su presencia."

Esta es una afirmación condicional (si A, entonces B). Sin embargo, en el contexto se indica que la camisa de Jorge está planchada (es decir, no está arrugada). 

En lógica, cuando la condición inicial de una proposición condicional (“si A”) no se cumple, la proposición completa no se puede usar para concluir si la consecuencia (“entonces B”) es verdadera o falsa.

Explicación: Según el contexto, se nos dice que Susana quiere leer y que no hay libros en la estantería.

Esta afirmación resulta falsa, ya que la condición (que Susana quiere leer) es verdadera, pero la consecuencia (que hay libros en la estantería) es falsa.

Explicación: María dijo: “Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza”. Esta es una proposición condicional. El hecho de que el loro esté en la jaula hace que la condición sea verdadera, pero eso no garantiza que la consecuencia (que Tomás haya traído pizza) también lo sea. Para confirmar si Tomás realmente trajo pizza, necesitaríamos una información adicional que lo confirme. Según el contexto dado, esa información no está incluida. Por lo tanto, no se puede asegurar que Tomás trajo pizza, solo que, según lo dicho por María, debería hacerlo si se cumple la condición."
S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza.

Sabemos por el contexto que el loro está en la jaula (A es verdadero), pero también sabemos que Tomás no trajo pizza (B es falso).

Entonces, según la información dada, Tomás no trajo pizza."

Explicación: María dijo: «Si el loro está en la jaula, entonces Tomás traerá pizza». Esto es una proposición condicional que solo asegura que si la primera parte (el loro está en la jaula) es verdadera, entonces la segunda (Tomás traerá pizza) debe serlo también.

Sin embargo, en el contexto se afirma que el loro no está en la jaula. Como la condición no se cumplió, la proposición no nos dice nada sobre lo que pasa si el loro no está en la jaula. Por lo tanto, no podemos concluir que Tomás trajo pizza.

Explicación:
María dijo: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"".

S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, según lo que decía María, no es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas.

Pero en el contexto se dice que hoy el tiempo está lluvioso y con viento, por lo tanto no está soleado. Dado que la condición para que Emma vaya de morado no se cumple, no podemos afirmar que Emma fue de morado. De hecho, según la lógica de la afirmación, es probable que no lo haya hecho."
