B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Yes, based on what Mary says, it is true that there is pizza in the oven.

Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven.""[1] This can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q, where P is ""John is hungry"" and Q is ""there is pizza in the oven.""

Since we know that John is hungry (P is true), we can apply **modus ponens**, which is a valid form of conditional reasoning.[1] Modus ponens states that when the antecedent (the ""if"" part or sufficient condition) of a conditional statement is true, we can validly conclude that the consequent (the ""then"" part or necessary condition) is also true.[1]

Therefore:
- Mary's statement: If John is hungry → there is pizza in the oven
- Fact: John is hungry ✓
- Valid conclusion: There is pizza in the oven ✓

This conclusion is further confirmed by the context, which explicitly states that there is pizza in the oven."
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven. According to the context provided, you are explicitly told that **there is no pizza in the oven**.

Mary's conditional statement—""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven""—can be analyzed to understand its truth value. The statement has the form: If H, then P, where H represents ""John is hungry"" and P represents ""there is pizza in the oven.""[1]

Given the facts:
- H is true (John is hungry)
- P is false (there is no pizza in the oven)

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true and the consequent (the ""then"" part) is false, the entire conditional statement is false.[2] This means Mary's statement is false—it contradicts reality.

However, the direct answer to your question comes straight from the given information: there is no pizza in the oven, so it is not true that there is pizza in the oven."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","Based on Mary's conditional statement alone, **we cannot determine whether there is pizza in the oven**.

Here's why:

Mary's statement ""If John is hungry, then there is pizza in the oven"" is a conditional statement where being hungry is the antecedent (the ""if"" part) and pizza being in the oven is the consequent (the ""then"" part)[1]. The antecedent represents a **sufficient condition**—meaning that if John were hungry, that would be all that's needed to conclude there is pizza[1].

However, since we know that **John is not hungry**, the sufficient condition is not met. The conditional statement only tells us what would be true if John were hungry; it says nothing about what is true when John is **not** hungry[3].

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the hypothesis (antecedent) is false, the conditional statement itself is true regardless of whether the conclusion (consequent) is true or false[3]. This means Mary's statement could be true whether or not there is pizza in the oven.

If we tried to conclude that pizza is in the oven simply because Mary's conditional statement is true, we would be committing a logical fallacy. The pasta in the fridge is irrelevant to determining the truth of Mary's statement.

**Conclusion:** The information provided is insufficient to determine whether there is pizza in the oven. You would need additional information, such as a direct observation or a different type of statement from Mary, to answer that question."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ","Yes, it is true that there is aspirin on the table.

Based on Mary's conditional statement, you can apply the logical rule called **modus ponens** to reach this conclusion[1]. Here's how it works:

**Mary's Statement Structure:**
- Antecedent (sufficient condition): ""Nicole's head hurts""
- Consequent (necessary condition): ""There is aspirin on the table""

The statement translates to: If Nicole's head hurts → then there is aspirin on the table[1]

**Applying Modus Ponens:**
Since we know that Nicole's head hurts (the antecedent is true), and Mary stated the conditional relationship, we can validly conclude that there is aspirin on the table (the consequent must be true)[1]. Modus ponens is a valid argument form where affirming the antecedent allows you to validly affirm the consequent[1].

Additionally, the context already confirms that aspirin is physically present on the table, so the conclusion is doubly verified—both through logical inference from Mary's statement and from the stated facts."
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No, it is not true that there is aspirin on the table. You are explicitly told in the context that there is no aspirin on the table.

## Analysis of Mary's Statement

Mary makes a conditional statement: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""[1] This can be written as:

Nicole's head hurts → Aspirin on the table

## Evaluating the Conditional

In this situation:
- The antecedent (sufficient condition) is TRUE: Nicole's head hurts
- The consequent (necessary condition) is FALSE: There is no aspirin on the table

According to the truth table for conditional statements, a conditional is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.[2] Since this is exactly the case here, **Mary's statement is false**—she made an incorrect claim.

However, the factual reality remains clear: there is no aspirin on the table. This is stated directly in the context, regardless of what Mary claims. Her conditional statement does not change the actual state of the world; it simply reveals that her claim about the relationship between Nicole's headache and the presence of aspirin is logically inconsistent with the facts."
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","# Conditional Reasoning Analysis

We cannot determine whether there is aspirin on the table based on the information given.

## Why

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table.""[1] This takes the logical form: **If P, then Q**, where:
- P = ""Nicole's head hurts""
- Q = ""There is aspirin on the table""

We know that P is **false** (Nicole's head does not hurt).

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is false, the conditional statement itself remains true regardless of whether the consequent (the ""then"" part) is true or false.[3] The conditional is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

## Valid Reasoning with Conditionals

The two valid forms of reasoning with conditionals are:[1]

**Modus Ponens**: If the antecedent is true, we can conclude the consequent is true.
- Since Nicole's head hurts → there is aspirin on the table

**Modus Tollens**: If the consequent is false, we can conclude the antecedent is false.
- Since there is no aspirin on the table → Nicole's head doesn't hurt

However, since Nicole's head does **not** hurt (the antecedent is false), neither of these reasoning patterns applies. We cannot work backward from a false antecedent to determine the truth value of the consequent. Mary's statement tells us nothing about whether aspirin is actually on the table when the condition ""Nicole's head hurts"" doesn't apply."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes, based on what Mary says and the given context, it is true that there is water in the fridge.

Here's why: Mary's statement is a conditional statement in the form ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge.""[1] This establishes that Lucy being thirsty is a **sufficient condition** for there being water in the fridge—meaning that if Lucy is thirsty, that's all that's needed to guarantee water is in the fridge.[1]

Since the context tells us that Lucy **is** thirsty, we can apply **modus ponens**, a valid form of logical reasoning.[1] Modus ponens states that when you have a conditional statement and the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true, you can validly conclude that the consequent (the ""then"" part) must also be true.[1] 

In this case:
- **Mary's conditional**: If Lucy is thirsty → there is water in the fridge
- **Given fact**: Lucy is thirsty (antecedent is true)
- **Valid conclusion**: There is water in the fridge (consequent is true)

This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the context explicitly states there is water in the fridge, so the conditional statement is logically sound."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No, it is not true that there is water in the fridge. The context explicitly states that there is no water in the fridge, regardless of what Mary claims.

However, Mary's conditional statement itself is **false**. Here's why:

A conditional statement ""If p, then q"" is structured with two parts: the antecedent (p) and the consequent (q)[1]. In Mary's statement:
- Antecedent (if part): ""Lucy is thirsty"" — this is **TRUE** (given in the context)
- Consequent (then part): ""There is water in the fridge"" — this is **FALSE** (given in the context)

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent is true but the consequent is false, the entire conditional statement is false[2]. This is the only case where a conditional statement fails to be true.

So while Mary made a claim in the form of a conditional statement, that statement is contradicted by reality. Lucy is indeed thirsty (satisfying the condition), but there is no water in the fridge (making the consequence untrue). Therefore, Mary's statement is logically false, and the answer to your question is definitively no—there is no water in the fridge."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Based on Mary's conditional statement and the given information, **we cannot determine whether there is water in the fridge**. The information is insufficient.

Here's why: Mary's statement ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"" establishes a conditional relationship: if the antecedent (Lucy is thirsty) is true, then the consequent (there is water in the fridge) must be true[1].

However, we know that Lucy is **not** thirsty. This means the antecedent is false. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement tells us nothing about whether the consequent is true or false[3]. According to the truth table for conditional statements, a conditional can be true whether the consequent is true or false when the antecedent is false[3].

The only way we could definitively conclude something about the water in the fridge would be if we either:

- Knew that Lucy **is** thirsty (affirming the antecedent using modus ponens)[1]
- Knew that there is **no** water in the fridge (using modus tollens to conclude Lucy is not thirsty)[1]

Since neither of these conditions applies, the statement ""There is water in the fridge"" remains undetermined—it could be true or false based solely on the information provided."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes, it is true that there is a charger in the drawer. This conclusion can be supported in two ways.

**From the given context:** You explicitly stated that there is a charger in the drawer as part of the scenario setup, so we know this is true independently.

**From logical reasoning:** Mary's statement follows the form of a conditional statement: ""If Peter's phone is dead, then there is a charger in the drawer.""[1] This can be written logically as: If A, then B, where A is ""Peter's phone is dead"" and B is ""there is a charger in the drawer.""[2]

Since we know that Peter's phone IS dead (given in the context), we have established the antecedent (the ""if"" part) as true.[1] When the antecedent of a conditional statement is confirmed to be true, we can validly conclude that the consequent (the ""then"" part) is also true. This logical form is called **modus ponens**.[1]

The reasoning works like this:
- Premise 1: If Peter's phone is dead, then there is a charger in the drawer
- Premise 2: Peter's phone is dead
- Conclusion: Therefore, there is a charger in the drawer

So based on Mary's conditional statement combined with the fact that Peter's phone is dead, we can logically conclude that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","# Analyzing the Conditional Statement

Let's carefully analyze this logical reasoning problem based on the information provided.

## Given Facts:
- Peter's phone is dead (this is stated as fact)
- There is no charger in the drawer (this is stated as fact)
- There is no computer on the table (this is stated as fact)

## Mary's Statement:
""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""

This is a conditional statement that can be represented as:
- If P (Peter's phone is dead), then C (there is a charger in the drawer)
- P → C

## Logical Analysis:

From the search results (particularly [1] and [2]), we understand that a conditional statement ""If P, then C"" has specific logical properties:

1. When P is true and C is true, the statement P → C is true
2. When P is true and C is false, the statement P → C is false
3. When P is false and C is true, the statement P → C is true
4. When P is false and C is false, the statement P → C is true

In this case:
- P is true (Peter's phone is dead - from the context)
- C is false (there is no charger in the drawer - from the context)

Since P is true and C is false, Mary's statement ""If P, then C"" must be false.

## Answering the Question:

The question asks: ""Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?""

This is asking us to evaluate whether Mary's statement implies that there is a charger in the drawer.

Mary's statement is: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer.""

However, we know from the context that:
- Peter's phone is dead (P is true)
- There is no charger in the drawer (C is false)

Mary's conditional statement would only tell us that there must be a charger in the drawer IF we assumed her statement was true AND we knew P was true (using modus ponens: if P → C and P, then C).

But in reality:
- Her statement is actually false because P is true while C is false
- The context explicitly states there is no charger in the drawer

Therefore, based on both Mary's statement (which turns out to be false) AND the factual context provided, it is NOT true that there is a charger in the drawer.

The answer is **no** - it is not true that there is a charger in the drawer. The context explicitly states there is no charger, and Mary's conditional statement is revealed to be false by this very fact."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No, we cannot determine whether there is a charger in the drawer based on Mary's statement.

Mary's statement is a conditional statement with the structure ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""Peter's phone is dead"" and Q is ""there is a charger in the drawer.""[1][2] In conditional logic, the part after ""if"" is called the sufficient condition, and the part after ""then"" is called the necessary condition.[3]

Since Peter's phone is fully charged, the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is false—Peter's phone is NOT dead. According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent is false, the entire conditional statement is true regardless of whether the conclusion is true or false.[2] This means:

- If there IS a charger in the drawer, Mary's statement is true
- If there is NO charger in the drawer, Mary's statement is still true

In other words, Mary's conditional statement tells us nothing definitive about the charger's existence when its antecedent is false. The truth value of the conditional statement is satisfied either way, so we have insufficient information to conclude whether the charger exists."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes, it is true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

This can be understood through conditional reasoning. Mary's statement follows the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""the weather is rainy"" and Q is ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""[1][2] This is represented logically as: If rainy → umbrella on coat rack.

Since we know that the weather is rainy (given in the context), we can apply the logical principle of **modus ponens**. Modus ponens states that when you have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and you confirm that P is true, you can validly conclude that Q must be true.[1] 

Therefore:
- Premise 1: If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack
- Premise 2: The weather is rainy (given)
- Conclusion: There is an umbrella on the coat rack

Additionally, the context explicitly confirms that there is indeed an umbrella on the coat rack, which aligns with what we can logically derive from Mary's conditional statement."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No, it is not true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack.

Mary's statement is a conditional of the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""the weather is rainy"" and Q is ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""[1][2] 

In this scenario, we know that:
- P is true (the weather is rainy)
- Q is false (there is no umbrella on the coat rack)

When a conditional statement has a true antecedent (the ""if"" part) and a false consequent (the ""then"" part), the conditional statement itself is false.[2] This means Mary's statement contradicts the actual facts.

If Mary's statement were true and the weather were rainy, then by **modus ponens** (a valid form of logical reasoning), there would necessarily be an umbrella on the coat rack.[1] However, since we know the weather is rainy but there is no umbrella present, Mary's conditional statement must be incorrect.

The context explicitly states there is no umbrella on the coat rack, so regardless of what Mary claims, the factual answer to your question is that there is no umbrella there."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","# Analysis of Mary's Conditional Statement

Mary's statement follows the form of a conditional: ""If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""[1] In logical terms, this is an if-then statement where the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is ""the weather is rainy"" and the consequent (the ""then"" part) is ""there is an umbrella on the coat rack.""[2]

## The Key Issue

The context tells us that **the weather is sunny**, which means the antecedent of Mary's conditional is **false**. This is the critical point for answering your question.

According to conditional logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the truth value of the consequent cannot be determined from the conditional statement alone.[2] The conditional statement itself is considered true (since a conditional with a false antecedent is always true regardless of the consequent), but this tells us nothing about whether the umbrella actually exists on the coat rack in reality.

## Conclusion

**No, we cannot determine from Mary's statement whether there is an umbrella on the coat rack.** Mary's conditional only tells us what would be true if it were raining. Since it's sunny, her statement provides no information about the actual state of the coat rack. The umbrella might or might not be there—we simply don't know based on what Mary said."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes, it is true that there is a pump in the garage.

This conclusion can be reached through **modus ponens**, a valid form of conditional reasoning[1]. Mary's statement follows the structure: ""If P, then Q"" where P is ""your tire is flat"" and Q is ""there is a pump in the garage.""

Since we know that:
- The tire IS flat (the antecedent/sufficient condition is true)
- Mary made a true conditional statement

Then by modus ponens, the consequent/necessary condition must also be true[1]. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, the consequent must be true for the conditional statement itself to be valid.

Additionally, you're explicitly told in the context that there is a pump in the garage, so this is directly confirmed by the facts of the situation."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No, it is not true that there is a pump in the garage. According to the context you provided, there is explicitly no pump in the garage.

Mary's statement uses a conditional (if-then) structure: ""If your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage.""[1] In logical form, this is: Flat Tire → Pump in Garage.

However, based on the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true but the consequent (the ""then"" part) is false, the entire conditional statement is false.[2] In your scenario:

- The antecedent is **true** (the tire is flat)
- The consequent is **false** (there is no pump in the garage)
- Therefore, Mary's conditional statement is **false**

This violates what's known as **modus ponens**—the logical rule that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.[1] Since we know the tire is flat and there is no pump, Mary's statement cannot be accurate. Her claim contradicts the actual situation."
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Based on what Mary says, **we cannot determine whether there is a pump in the garage**.

Mary's statement is a conditional statement with the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""your tire is flat"" and Q is ""there is a pump in the garage.""[1][3] Since you know your tire is **not** flat, the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is false.

The key principle from conditional logic is that when the antecedent is false, we cannot draw any valid conclusion about the consequent.[1] The conditional statement only guarantees that **if** the tire were flat, then a pump would exist in the garage. However, it says nothing about whether a pump exists when the tire is not flat.

The only way to determine something definitive would be through **modus tollens**: if you knew there was **no** pump in the garage, you could validly conclude the tire is not flat. But you cannot work backward from the current information to determine the pump's existence.[1]

In summary, Mary's conditional statement is consistent with three possibilities: (1) there is a pump and the tire is not flat, (2) there is no pump and the tire is not flat, or (3) there is a pump and the tire is flat. Without additional information, you cannot eliminate any of these scenarios."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes, it is true that there is a water can on the shelf.

This can be established in two ways:

**From the context:** You are explicitly told that there is a water can on the shelf, so this is directly stated as a fact.

**From conditional logic:** Mary's statement follows the structure ""If the plant is dry, then there is a water can on the shelf.""[1] This creates a conditional where:
- The antecedent (sufficient condition) is: ""the plant is dry""
- The consequent (necessary condition) is: ""there is a water can on the shelf""[1]

Since you know that the plant **is** dry (the antecedent is true), and Mary's conditional statement is valid, you can apply **modus ponens**—a valid form of logical reasoning.[1] Modus ponens states that when you have a true conditional statement and the antecedent is true, the consequent must also be true.[1] Therefore, there must be a water can on the shelf.

The conclusion holds true both from the factual information provided and from the logical structure of Mary's conditional statement."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No, it is not true that there is a water can on the shelf.

The context explicitly states that **there is no water can on the shelf**. This is a factual statement given in the problem setup.

Mary's conditional statement—""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf""—can be analyzed separately. Since we know that:
- The plant **is** dry (the antecedent is true)
- There is **no** water can on the shelf (the consequent is false)

Mary's conditional statement itself is **false**. According to the truth table for conditional statements, a conditional ""if P, then Q"" is only false when the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false, which is exactly the case here.[2]

So the answer to your question is directly: **No**, there is no water can on the shelf, and furthermore, Mary's statement is not a true conditional statement given the actual facts."
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"".

- **Antecedent** (the ""if"" part): The plant is dry
- **Consequent** (the ""then"" part): There is a water can on the shelf

Since the plant is **not dry**, the antecedent of Mary's conditional is false. However, this tells us nothing about whether the consequent is true. A conditional statement only guarantees the consequent when the antecedent is true.[1]

As explained in conditional logic, when the antecedent does not occur, we cannot make any inference about the consequent.[1] The consequent could still be true for other reasons, or it could be false—the conditional statement doesn't constrain it either way. Just because we're not in the scenario Mary described (a dry plant) doesn't mean the water can is absent from the shelf; it could be there for any number of other reasons, or it could be elsewhere.

To actually determine whether the water can is on the shelf, you would need additional information beyond Mary's conditional statement."

**From logical reasoning:** Mary's statement is a conditional statement in the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""George's shirt is wrinkled"" and Q is ""there is an iron in the closet.""[1] Since we know from the context that George's shirt is wrinkled (P is true), we can apply **modus ponens**—a valid argument form in conditional reasoning.[1] Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true, then the consequent (the ""then"" part) must also be true.[1] Therefore, we can logically conclude that there is an iron in the closet."

- There is **no** iron in the closet (the consequence is false)

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true and the consequent (the ""then"" part) is false, the entire conditional statement is false.[2] Mary's statement asserts a logical relationship that doesn't hold in reality. Since the shirt is wrinkled but there is no iron available, her claim that the presence of a wrinkled shirt would necessitate an iron in the closet is demonstrably incorrect."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Based on the conditional statement Mary provides, we **cannot determine** whether there is an iron in the closet.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet."" This establishes that a wrinkled shirt is a sufficient condition for an iron being in the closet[1]. In logical form: Wrinkled Shirt → Iron in Closet.

However, we're told that George's shirt is **not** wrinkled. This means we're denying the antecedent (the ""if"" part) of the conditional statement.

In conditional reasoning, there are only two valid forms of inference[1]:

1. **Modus ponens**: Affirming the antecedent allows you to conclude the consequent
2. **Modus tollens**: Denying the consequent allows you to conclude the denial of the antecedent

What we have here—denying the antecedent—is neither of these valid forms. When the sufficient condition doesn't occur, we cannot conclude anything about whether the necessary condition holds or not[3].

Think of it this way: Mary's statement tells us what would be true *if* the shirt were wrinkled, but it says nothing about what's true when the shirt is *not* wrinkled. The iron could still be in the closet for other reasons, or it might not be there at all. The conditional simply doesn't provide information for this scenario.

Therefore, based solely on Mary's statement and the fact that George's shirt is not wrinkled, we cannot conclude whether there is an iron in the closet."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","# Analysis of Mary's Conditional Statement

Based on the context provided, **yes, it is true that there are books on the shelf**. This is explicitly stated as a fact in the given scenario: ""there are books on the shelf.""

## Understanding Mary's Statement as a Conditional

Mary's statement is a **conditional statement** of the form ""If P, then Q,"" where:[1]

- **P (antecedent):** ""Susy wants to read"" — which is TRUE according to the context
- **Q (consequent):** ""There are books on the shelf"" — which is TRUE according to the context

According to the truth table for conditionals, a conditional statement is **only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false**[2]. In all other cases, it is true. Since both the antecedent and consequent are true in this scenario (T → T), Mary's conditional statement is **true**[3].

## The Key Distinction

It's important to note that Mary did not directly assert that ""there are books on the shelf."" Instead, she made a **conditional claim**: she linked the existence of books to Susy's desire to read. However, because we know from the context that:

1. Susy wants to read (the condition is met)
2. There genuinely are books on the shelf

Both parts of her conditional statement align with reality, making the conditional true. The fact that there are books on the shelf remains true regardless of Mary's statement—it's established as part of the given scenario."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, there are no books on the shelf. This is stated directly in the context: ""there are no books on the shelf.""

To understand why Mary's statement is problematic, consider her conditional statement: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf.""[1][2] In conditional logic, this statement has two parts—the antecedent (""Susy wants to read"") and the consequent (""there are books on the shelf"").

Since we know that:
- Susy **does** want to read (the antecedent is true)
- There are **no** books on the shelf (the consequent is false)

Mary's statement is **false**. According to the truth table for conditional statements, a conditional is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.[3] In all other cases, it remains true. Here, we have exactly that scenario: the condition is met, but the result is not.

So while Mary claims there would be books on the shelf if Susy wants to read, the reality contradicts her statement. Despite what Mary says, there are genuinely no books on the shelf."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No, you cannot determine from Mary's statement whether there are books on the shelf.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Susy wants to read, then there are books on the shelf."" This type of statement only tells you what must be true when the condition is met. Since we know that Susy does **not** want to read, the conditional statement provides no information about whether books are actually on the shelf.

In logic, a conditional statement of the form ""If P, then Q"" only guarantees Q is true when P is true. When P is false (as in this case), the statement tells us nothing about Q. The conditional is still logically valid whether books are on the shelf or not.

To know whether there are books on the shelf, you would need different information—such as a direct statement about the books, or a biconditional statement like ""There are books on the shelf **if and only if** Susy wants to read."""
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Yes, pizza is significantly more popular than pasta in the United States. When Americans are asked to choose between the two, 62% select pizza over pasta, with only 38% choosing pasta.[1] This preference remains consistent across most demographic groups and regions.

The popularity of pizza is reflected in consumption patterns and the food industry landscape. On average, each person in the U.S. eats 25 pounds of pizza annually (approximately 46 slices), and an estimated 1 in 8 Americans eat pizza each day.[3][7] Additionally, 94% of all Americans eat pizza regularly.[3] The pizza industry generates $30 billion annually in the U.S., with approximately 73,000 pizzerias operating nationwide.[3]

Pizza's popularity advantage holds across most demographics, though some variations exist. Men show stronger pizza preference than women (64% vs. 52%), middle-aged Americans (30-64) show the strongest pizza preference at 62-63%, and urban dwellers favor pizza more than rural Americans (66% vs. 52%).[1] The Midwest region shows the highest pizza preference at 67%.[1]"

F2T,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is green tea more used than black coffee?","No, green tea is not more used than black coffee. In fact, the opposite is true globally.

Worldwide consumption data shows that **coffee is consumed significantly more than tea**. Globally, the average person consumes 8.2 times more coffee (3.42 kg annually) than tea (0.42 kg annually)[5]. On a per-capita basis, total coffee consumption (148.64 kg per person) is 6.1 times higher than tea consumption (24.56 kg per person)[5].

This consumption gap exists across virtually all major regions. Europe consumes 11.1 times more coffee than tea, the Americas consume 4.4 times more coffee than tea, and even Asia—where tea originated—consumes 1.3 times more coffee than tea[5]. While tea is the second-most consumed beverage worldwide, coffee remains the clear preference in terms of volume consumed[9][13].

Regarding the specific beverages you mentioned, the search results indicate that **black tea is the most consumed type of tea globally**[9], making it the primary tea variety. However, even with black tea being the leading tea type, coffee overall—including black coffee—maintains substantially higher consumption levels worldwide."
F2F,English,"Here's the context: Although black coffee is cheaper than green tea, most people prefer green tea. There is black coffee in the pot. In this context, is black coffee more used than green tea?","Based on the available consumption data, **yes, black coffee is used significantly more than green tea globally**. Coffee consumption overall far exceeds tea consumption worldwide—people consume **8.2 times more coffee than tea annually** on a global average basis, with total coffee consumption being **6.1 times higher than tea consumption** per person worldwide[5]. Since black coffee represents the predominant form of coffee consumption and black tea is the most consumed type of tea globally[11], black coffee would logically account for a substantially larger share of overall beverage consumption than green tea.

This consumption pattern is consistent across most regions. For example, Europe consumes 11.1 times more coffee than tea per person, while the Americas consume 4.4 times more coffee than tea, and Asia consumes 1.3 times more coffee than tea[5]. The statement in your context that ""most people prefer green tea"" actually contradicts the observed global consumption data, which shows a strong preference for coffee across virtually all regions."
F3T,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is soda more in demand than water?","No, soda is not more in demand than water. Bottled water has significantly surpassed carbonated soft drinks as the most consumed beverage in the United States.

In 2024, per capita bottled water consumption reached 47.3 gallons, compared to just 34.8 gallons for carbonated soft drinks—a difference of 12.5 gallons per person.[5] On a total volume basis, bottled water consumption reached 16.4 billion gallons in 2024, while carbonated soft drinks only reached 11.9 billion gallons.[7] Bottled water has maintained its position as the number one beverage by volume in the United States for nine consecutive years.[7]

This shift reflects changing consumer preferences driven by health consciousness. Per capita soft drink consumption has declined steadily, with consumption contracting at an annualized rate of 0.5% from 2020 to 2025.[1] The decline is attributed to increased awareness of health risks associated with sugar-sweetened beverages, including obesity and diabetes. Meanwhile, consumers have increasingly turned to alternative beverages, particularly bottled water and carbonated water products, which offer perceived health benefits.[1]

Bottled water continues to outpace other beverages in growth as well. In 2024, bottled water grew by 2.9 percent, while carbonated soft drinks grew by only 0.2 percent.[7] Industry projections suggest that bottled water's dominance will continue, with expectations that it will further distance itself from carbonated soft drinks in the coming years.[5]"
F3F,English,"Here's the context: Although water is healthier than soda, many choose soda. There is water in the freezer. In this context, is water more in demand than soda?","Yes, water is significantly more in demand than soda in the United States. This shift represents a major change in beverage preferences over the past decade.

**Current Consumption Levels**

Bottled water has become the dominant beverage category by volume. In 2024, per capita bottled water consumption reached 47.3 gallons compared to just 34.8 gallons for carbonated soft drinks[3]. This means bottled water consumption exceeded soft drink consumption by 12.5 gallons per person annually[3]. In 2025, soft drink consumption is estimated to reach 42.2 gallons per capita, continuing a long-term declining trend[1].

**Volume and Market Share**

By total volume consumed, bottled water dominated the beverage market in 2024 with 16.4 billion gallons (up 2.9%), while carbonated soft drinks lagged at 11.9 billion gallons (up only 0.2%)[5]. Bottled water maintained its position as the number one beverage by volume for the ninth consecutive year in 2024[5].

**Drivers of the Shift**

The increased demand for water reflects growing health consciousness among consumers. Since 2020, per capita soft drink consumption has contracted at an annualized rate of 0.5%, primarily driven by consumer awareness of health risks associated with sugar-sweetened beverages, including obesity and diabetes[1]. Additionally, consumers have shifted away from diet sodas due to concerns about artificial sweeteners. Many have switched to alternatives like bottled water and carbonated water products, which are perceived as healthier options with fewer calories[1].

**Recent Developments**

It's worth noting that while bottled water remains the dominant packaged beverage, coffee has recently surpassed it as the most consumed beverage overall when measuring daily consumption patterns, with two-thirds of American adults drinking coffee daily[12]."

In this context, are burgers more popular than sushi?","Based on the available information, yes, burgers do appear to be more popular than sushi, particularly in the United States. The search results indicate that hamburgers have historically dominated American fast food culture, having ""reigned supreme as the ideal meal item to eat when you don't feel like cooking"" for decades[1]. 

Additionally, research on American dietary patterns shows that hamburgers and cheeseburgers have maintained substantial presence in the food consumption landscape, with these items representing 18% of calories consumed in 1977-1978 and increasing to 27.7% by 1994-1996[2]. This data suggests that burgers have not only remained popular but have actually increased their share of caloric intake over time.

That said, it's worth noting that sushi has gained considerable traction as an alternative option in recent years. Sushi restaurants exist as significant establishments in many cities, and sushi is recognized as offering advantages over burgers—including more intricate and varied flavors, being perceived as lighter and healthier, and providing a more interesting culinary experience with diverse seafood options[1]. However, these qualities haven't yet translated into sushi surpassing burgers in overall consumption frequency among the general population, at least not in Western markets.

The popularity gap may also reflect differences in accessibility, affordability, cultural familiarity, and dining convenience, with burgers remaining the more accessible and normalized fast food choice for most consumers."

The average American eats roughly 3 burgers each week[1], indicating burgers are a regular part of most people's diets. Additionally, nearly 40% of U.S. restaurants have some kind of burger on their menus[1], reflecting the widespread availability and demand for this food.

Burgers also dominate social media engagement, with smash burgers alone accounting for roughly 70% of burger-related Instagram posts[1]. The burger market continues to show strong growth, with the number of smash burgers appearing on restaurant menus increasing by 21.9% between the third quarters of 2023 and 2024[1].

While sushi has established itself as a popular cuisine in the U.S., with trends suggesting increased popularity by 2025[12], the search results do not provide comparable consumption frequency data for sushi that would match burger consumption levels.

F7T,English,"Here's the context: Although dogs are more lively than cats, people prefer them. There is a cat up in the tree. In this context, are dogs more popular than cats?","Yes, dogs are more popular than cats both in the United States and globally.

In the U.S., the difference is substantial. About 74 percent of pet owners have a dog compared to 47 percent with a cat[1]. In terms of households, dogs are found in approximately 68 million U.S. households, compared to around 46.5 million households with cats[6][7]. This translates to roughly 89.7 million dogs in the U.S. versus 73.8 million cats[5].

The preference for dogs extends beyond the U.S. as well. Globally, dogs are the most popular pet, present in around one in three homes[8]. In other major regions, including mainland China, the United Kingdom, and Japan, dogs maintain a comfortable lead over cats[1]. The only exception is Germany, where the competition is much closer, with dogs at 51 percent and cats at 50 percent among pet owners[1].

The gap in popularity likely reflects differences in how these animals interact with their owners. Dogs tend to be more loyal, trainable, and capable of forming strong emotional bonds, while cats are more independent and aloof. Additionally, dog owners tend to spend more on their pets and consider them equal family members more often than cat owners do[3]."

In 2024, 45.5 million U.S. households owned dogs compared to 32.1 million households that owned cats.[5][7] In terms of percentages, 45.5% of U.S. households have dogs versus 32.1% with cats.[7] When looking at pet owners specifically, 74% of pet owners in the U.S. said they have a dog, compared to just 47% with a cat.[1]

This pattern holds internationally as well. In the United Kingdom, Japan, and mainland China, dogs also maintain a comfortable lead over cats.[1] Germany represents the closest competition, with dogs at 51% ownership and cats at 50%.[1]

That said, the popularity gap is narrowing. Between 2019 and 2024, dog ownership declined by 2% while cat ownership grew by 5%, representing a significant shift in pet preferences.[3] Additionally, households with only cats increased from 21% in 2018 to 24% in 2024, while households with only dogs declined from 57% to 52% during the same period.[3] This trend reflects the fact that cats are often easier and less expensive to maintain, making them increasingly appealing to younger generations, dual-worker households, and aging populations.[3]"

Americans aged 15 and older spend an average of 2 hours and 40 minutes to 2 hours and 51 minutes watching TV daily, compared to only 15-16 minutes reading for personal interest on any given day[3]. A 2023 study by WordsRated confirmed that people are more likely to watch television than read a book[6].

Among teenagers specifically, the gap is even more pronounced. Less than 20 percent of U.S. teens report reading a book, magazine, or newspaper daily for pleasure, while more than 80 percent use social media every day[1]. This shift reflects a broader trend where time spent on digital media and television has displaced time previously devoted to reading[1]."

In this context, are more people reading books than watching TV?","No, more people are watching TV than reading books.[1][4] The data shows a significant disparity between these two activities.

In 2023, only 14.6% of Americans age 15 and older were intensive readers (reading more than 20 minutes daily), whereas approximately 79% spent more than 20 minutes daily watching shows, gaming, or using computers for personal interest.[1] Additionally, a 2023 study found that people are more likely to watch television than read a book.[4]

The time spent on each activity further illustrates this gap. From 2017 to 2023, Americans aged 15 and older spent roughly 15-16 minutes per day reading for personal interest, while they spent between 2 hours and 40 minutes to 2 hours and 51 minutes watching TV on any given day.[3] Moreover, 84% of Americans in 2023 read for five minutes or less per day, whereas only 19% spent that little time watching shows or consuming other electronic content.[1]

The reason walking maintains such widespread popularity is partly due to its accessibility and ease. Walking is safe, easy to stick with, low- or no-cost, and doesn't require any special skills or equipment.[11] This makes it an attractive option for people of all fitness levels, ages, and backgrounds, whereas running demands more physical intensity and carries a higher risk of injury—walkers face a 1%-5% chance of exercise-related injury compared to runners' 20%-70% risk.[1]"

While running offers certain fitness advantages—such as burning more calories per minute and providing greater cardiovascular benefits in a shorter time period—its lower popularity reflects that many people find walking more accessible, sustainable, and aligned with their lifestyle preferences. Walking requires no special training, has a lower injury risk, and can be easily incorporated into daily routines, which likely contributes to its broader appeal across the population."
S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","# Conditional Reasoning Analysis

Based on Mary's statement and the given facts, **yes, it must be true that Thomas brought pizza**.

Here's why: Mary made a conditional statement following the form ""If P, then Q,"" where P is ""the parrot is in the cage"" and Q is ""Thomas will bring pizza.""[1] Since we know that the parrot **is** in the cage (P is true), we can apply the principle of **modus ponens** from conditional logic. In modus ponens, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) of a conditional statement is affirmed, the consequent (the ""then"" part) logically must be true.[1]

Therefore, given that:
- Mary stated the conditional rule: If the parrot is in the cage → Thomas brings pizza
- The condition is satisfied: The parrot is in the cage

We can conclude with logical certainty that Thomas brought pizza.

Note that the fact about the dog being in the doghouse is irrelevant to this conclusion, as it doesn't affect Mary's conditional statement about the parrot and Thomas."
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not true that Thomas brought pizza. You are explicitly told that ""Thomas did not bring pizza.""

However, there is a logical contradiction in this scenario. According to Mary's conditional statement and the established facts, Thomas should have brought pizza.

Here's why: Mary's statement ""If the parrot is in the cage, then Thomas will bring pizza"" establishes a conditional relationship where the parrot being in the cage is the **sufficient condition** and Thomas bringing pizza is the **necessary condition**[1]. Since the parrot **is** in the cage (as stated), and the antecedent is true, then by **modus ponens**, the consequent must logically follow—meaning Thomas must bring pizza[1].

But you've also been told that Thomas did **not** bring pizza, which contradicts what Mary's statement logically requires. This means either:
- Mary's statement was incorrect or doesn't actually apply to this situation, or
- There's an inconsistency in the scenario presented

So while the logical inference from Mary's statement would suggest Thomas brought pizza, the factual statement given contradicts this."
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"".

Here's why:

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the parrot is in the cage, then Thomas will bring pizza.""[1] This creates a logical relationship where:

- **Antecedent (sufficient condition):** The parrot is in the cage
- **Consequent (necessary condition):** Thomas will bring pizza

We are told that the parrot is **not** in the cage. However, this does not allow us to conclude anything definitive about whether Thomas brought pizza.

This situation illustrates what's known as the **fallacy of denying the antecedent**.[1] Just because the condition (antecedent) is false does not mean the consequence (consequent) must also be false. As explained in conditional reasoning, the if-clause is not a necessary condition.[5] In other words, Thomas could have brought pizza for reasons entirely unrelated to whether the parrot is in the cage—perhaps Mary asked him to, or he simply decided to on his own.

Mary's conditional statement only guarantees what happens **if** the parrot **is** in the cage. Since that condition isn't met, her statement tells us nothing about whether Thomas actually brought pizza or not. The answer could be yes or no—**the information is insufficient to determine the truth value**."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Based on Mary's conditional promise, **yes, according to the promise, Mark should give you a candy**.

Here's the logical analysis:

Mary's statement is a conditional promise: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy."" This means the commitment (Mark giving you candy) is operative when the condition (you finishing your broccoli) is satisfied[1][3].

Since you have fulfilled the condition by finishing your broccoli, the conditional promise is now operative. According to the structure of conditional promises, when all conditions are met, the promised commitment should be delivered[1].

However, it's important to note that the conditional promise creates an obligation or expectation based on the condition being met—it means Mark is committed to giving you the candy. Whether Mark actually follows through on this promise is a separate question about his reliability or trustworthiness in honoring the commitment. The promise itself, once its condition is satisfied, means the candy delivery is expected to occur[3]."

Mary made an if-then statement: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy.""[1][2] This conditional statement has two parts:

- **Hypothesis (the ""if"" part):** You finish your broccoli
- **Conclusion (the ""then"" part):** Mark will give you a candy

Since you finished your broccoli, the hypothesis is true. According to the conditional statement, when the hypothesis is true, the conclusion must also be true for the statement to hold.[1][4] This is a valid form of deductive reasoning called modus ponens: if the hypothesis of a true conditional is satisfied, then the conclusion must be true.

In your case:
- You finished your broccoli ✓ (hypothesis is true)
- Therefore, Mark gave you a candy ✓ (conclusion must be true)

The detail that Mary did not give you a candy is simply clarifying that it was Mark, not Mary, who would provide the candy—it doesn't contradict the conclusion that Mark gave you one."

According to the truth table for conditional statements, when the antecedent is false, the conditional statement itself is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent[1][11]. This means Mary's promise is technically not broken—she never entered into a contract since you didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.

However, the conditional statement only tells us what happens if you finish your broccoli (you would get candy). Since you didn't finish your broccoli, the condition that triggers the promise was never met. Mary's statement provides no information about whether Mark would give you candy if you didn't finish your broccoli.

In other words:
- If you had finished your broccoli and didn't get candy, Mary's promise would be broken (false)
- Since you didn't finish your broccoli, Mary's promise neither applies nor is violated—it simply doesn't address this scenario

So based solely on what Mary says, we cannot determine the truth value of whether Mark gave you candy."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Yes, it is true that Susan got a camera.

Based on Mary's statement, ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera,"" there is a logical conditional: whenever the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera. Since the context establishes that the foxes **are** dancing, the condition is met. Therefore, by logical deduction, Susan got a camera.

The fact that the squirrels are eating does not affect this conclusion, as Mary's statement only specifies the foxes dancing as the trigger for Susan getting a camera."
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on Mary's conditional statement and the given facts, **yes, it is true that Susan will get a camera**.

Here's the logical reasoning: Mary's statement creates a conditional relationship—""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera."" Since we know the foxes ARE dancing, this triggers the conditional. When the condition in an if-then statement is met (the antecedent is true), the consequence must follow. This is known as modus ponens, where affirming the antecedent results in the logically valid assertion of the consequent.[1]

In this case:
- **The antecedent** (the if-clause): ""the foxes are dancing"" ✓ TRUE
- **The consequent** (the then-clause): ""Susan will get a camera"" ✓ MUST FOLLOW

Therefore, Susan will get a camera."
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","Based on conditional logic, **we cannot determine whether Susan got a camera** from the information provided.

Mary's statement establishes a conditional relationship: ""If the foxes are dancing → Susan will get a camera."" This tells us what must be true if the antecedent (foxes dancing) is true, but it does NOT tell us what happens when the antecedent is false.[1]

Since we know the foxes are NOT dancing, we are in a situation where the antecedent has been denied. This is a logical fallacy known as ""denying the antecedent,"" which is invalid reasoning.[1] The conditional statement provides no information about what occurs in this scenario.

For example, the rule could have one of these outcomes:
- Susan could have gotten a camera for some other reason (perhaps as a gift)
- Susan could have not gotten a camera

Both are consistent with Mary's original statement, since that statement only constrains what happens when the foxes ARE dancing. Therefore, **Susan may or may not have gotten a camera** — we simply cannot know based on the conditional statement alone.[3][5]"
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Based on the conditional statement Mary made and the information given, **yes, it is logically valid to conclude that Matthew baked cookies.**

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"" is a conditional statement structured as ""If P, then Q,"" where[1]:
- **P (antecedent)** = The TV is on
- **Q (consequent)** = Matthew will bake cookies

Since the TV is on (P is true), we can apply **modus ponens**, a valid form of conditional reasoning[1]. According to modus ponens, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is affirmed (confirmed as true), we can logically conclude that the consequent must also be true[1].

Therefore:
- The TV is on ✓ (P is true)
- If the TV is on, then Matthew will bake cookies ✓ (conditional established)
- **Conclusion: Matthew baked cookies** ✓ (Q is true)

The fact that the radio is also on is irrelevant to this conclusion, as Mary's conditional statement only specifies a relationship between the TV being on and Matthew baking cookies."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is not true that Matthew baked cookies. According to the given information, Matthew did not bake cookies.

However, this situation demonstrates an important principle in conditional logic. Mary's statement establishes a conditional: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies.""[1] Since the TV is indeed on (which is confirmed in the context), the logical structure called **modus ponens** would normally allow us to conclude that Matthew should bake cookies. Modus ponens states that when you affirm the antecedent (the ""if"" part of a conditional statement), you can validly conclude the consequent (the ""then"" part).[1]

Yet the reality contradicts this logical expectation—Matthew did not bake cookies despite the TV being on. This reveals that Mary's conditional statement, while logically structured, does not actually hold true in practice. The statement may have been an inaccurate prediction or a rule that simply didn't apply in this instance. This is an important lesson in distinguishing between **logical validity** (what a conditional statement structurally requires) and **factual reality** (what actually happened)."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No, it is **not necessarily true** that Matthew baked cookies.

Mary's statement is a conditional statement of the form ""If P, then Q,"" where:
- **P (antecedent)**: The TV is on
- **Q (consequent)**: Matthew will bake cookies

A conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the consequent when the antecedent is true.[1][3] Since the TV is off, the antecedent is false. When the antecedent of a conditional is false, the statement tells us nothing definitive about whether the consequent is true or false.[3]

In other words, Mary's statement only specifies what happens IF the TV is on. Since the TV is not on, her statement provides no information about whether Matthew actually baked cookies or not. Matthew may or may not have baked cookies—the conditional statement is simply silent on the matter when its triggering condition (the TV being on) does not occur."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","Yes, based on Mary's conditional statement, it is logically true that Emma wore purple.

Mary's statement establishes a conditional relationship: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple.""[1] This can be represented as Sunny → Emma wears purple, where the weather being sunny is the antecedent (the sufficient condition) and Emma wearing purple is the consequent.[1]

Since we know that the weather is indeed sunny today, we can apply the logical principle of **modus ponens**.[1] This rule states that when the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, we can validly conclude that the consequent is also true.[1]

Therefore:
- Condition (Antecedent): The weather is sunny ✓ (given as true)
- Consequence (Consequent): Emma will wear purple ✓ (logically follows)

By the rules of conditional logic, since the sufficient condition (sunny weather) is satisfied, the result (Emma wearing purple) must necessarily follow from Mary's statement. So yes, it is true that Emma wore purple."
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, it is not true that Emma wore purple. Emma is wearing green.

Mary's statement is a conditional that claims: ""If the weather is sunny, then Emma will wear purple."" While the antecedent of this conditional is true (the weather is indeed sunny), the consequent is false (Emma is wearing green, not purple). According to the truth conditions for conditional statements, when the antecedent is true but the consequent is false, the conditional statement itself is false.[3] Therefore, Mary's claim does not hold in reality, and we can conclude that Emma did not wear purple—she wore green."
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No, we cannot determine whether Emma wore purple based on the information given.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the weather is sunny, then Emma will wear purple.""[1] This statement only tells us what would happen if the weather were sunny. Since today the weather is rainy and windy—not sunny—the condition is not met, and the conditional statement does not apply.

In conditional logic, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is false, the conditional statement itself may still be true, but it tells us nothing about whether the consequent (the ""then"" part) is true or false.[3] We cannot conclude that Emma did not wear purple, nor can we conclude that she did. The conditional simply does not provide information about what Emma wore on a rainy, windy day."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on Mary's conditional statement and the given facts, **yes, it is true that Angela took a selfie**.

Here's the logical reasoning:

Mary's statement establishes a conditional: ""If the playground is empty, then Angela will take a selfie."" We know that the playground is indeed empty. Using the logical principle of **modus ponens**, when the antecedent (the ""if"" part) of a conditional statement is true, we can validly conclude that the consequent (the ""then"" part) is also true.[1]

In this case:
- **Conditional:** If the playground is empty → Angela will take a selfie
- **Given fact:** The playground is empty ✓
- **Valid conclusion:** Angela took a selfie

This is a straightforward application of modus ponens, a fundamental form of valid deductive reasoning in conditional logic.[1] When a condition is satisfied and we have an explicit conditional statement linking that condition to an outcome, we can logically affirm that the outcome occurred."
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on the conditional statement Mary made and the facts provided, **no, it is not true that Angela took a selfie**. We are explicitly told that ""Angela did not take a selfie.""

However, this creates a logical contradiction with Mary's statement. Let me explain using conditional reasoning principles:

Mary's statement can be diagrammed as: If the playground is empty → Angela takes a selfie[1]. The antecedent (playground is empty) and the consequent (Angela takes a selfie) form a conditional relationship where the antecedent is the sufficient condition and the consequent is the necessary condition[1].

Since we know the playground **is** empty (the antecedent is true), the logical form called *modus ponens* tells us that the consequent must follow[1]. In other words, when the antecedent is affirmed, the consequent must logically be asserted as true[1].

According to Mary's conditional logic, if the playground is empty, then Angela **must** take a selfie. Since the playground is indeed empty, Mary's statement logically implies that Angela should have taken a selfie.

Yet we are also told that Angela did **not** take a selfie. This means either Mary's statement is false or there is an inconsistency in the given information. In terms of what actually happened in reality, Angela did not take a selfie, making the direct answer to your question simply: **no, Angela did not take a selfie.**"
S6C,English,"Here's the context: The playground is crowded.  Also, the streets are lively. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?","Based on Mary's statement, we cannot determine whether Angela took a selfie.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie."" This only tells us what will happen if the playground is empty. Since the playground is actually crowded (not empty), the condition in Mary's statement is not met.

In logic, when the condition of an if-then statement is false, the statement tells us nothing about whether the consequence occurred. Angela could have taken a selfie for other reasons, or she might not have taken one at all. Mary's conditional statement simply doesn't provide information about what Angela does when the playground is crowded.

Therefore, **it is not true to say that Angela took a selfie based on what Mary said**, nor is it true to say she didn't. The answer is indeterminate based on the given information."
S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","Based on the information provided, **we cannot determine whether Paul got 50 euros**.

Here's why: Mary's statement ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"" is a conditional statement. It tells us that **if Paul is the one who mowed the lawn**, then he will receive 50 euros. However, knowing that the lawn has been mowed does not tell us **who** mowed it.

Someone else could have mowed the lawn instead of Paul. The conditional statement only guarantees payment if Paul specifically is the one who performed the task. Without explicit confirmation that Paul was the one who mowed the lawn, we cannot conclude that he received the 50 euros, even though the lawn is definitively mowed.

In other words, the fact that the lawn is mowed is not sufficient evidence to confirm the consequent of Mary's conditional statement."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros. According to the information provided, Paul did not get 50 euros.

However, this reveals a broken conditional promise. Mary stated ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros."" Since the lawn has been mowed (satisfying the condition), Mary's conditional promise should have been fulfilled. Yet Paul did not receive the 50 euros, which means the promise failed.[1][2]

In logical terms, Mary's conditional promise can be written as: ""If Paul mows the lawn → Paul gets 50 euros."" When a condition is satisfied but the promised outcome does not occur, the conditional promise is not honored. This demonstrates why conditional promises require careful attention to both the condition and its fulfillment—a promise made subject to a condition only has value if the promised commitment is actually delivered when that condition is met.[1]"
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No, it is not true that Paul got 50 euros.

Mary made a conditional statement: ""**If** Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros."" This is a logical rule that establishes a payment condition—Paul receives 50 euros only if the action (mowing the lawn) is completed.

According to the context provided, the lawn has **not** been mowed. Since the condition of Mary's statement has not been satisfied, we cannot conclude that Paul received the payment. The conditional promise only applies if Paul actually mows the lawn, which he did not do. Without the lawn being mowed, Mary's statement tells us nothing about whether Paul received 50 euros or not."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","Based on Mary's conditional statement and the given facts, **yes**, we can conclude that Anthony will read a book.

Here's the reasoning:

Mary's statement establishes a conditional: ""If the dog is playing → Anthony will read a book.""[1] The antecedent (the ""if"" part) is ""the dog is playing,"" and the consequent (the ""then"" part) is ""Anthony will read a book.""[1]

Since we know that the dog **is** playing, the antecedent is true. In conditional logic, when the antecedent is true, we can validly conclude that the consequent must also be true. This is known as **modus ponens**—the affirmation of the antecedent results in the logically valid assertion of the consequent.[1]

Therefore, given that the condition has been met (the dog is playing), we can logically conclude that Anthony will read a book.

Note: If the question asks whether this is already true in the past tense, that would depend on when this statement is being evaluated. Mary's statement itself uses future tense (""will read""), so based purely on the conditional logic provided, we can affirm that the consequent follows necessarily from the true antecedent."

Mary said ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book,"" which is a conditional statement where the dog playing is the antecedent (sufficient condition) and Anthony reading a book is the consequent (necessary condition).[1] Since the dog is indeed playing, Mary's conditional statement would logically require that Anthony reads a book through what's known as modus ponens—when the antecedent is true, the consequent must follow.[1]

Yet we're explicitly told that Anthony did not read a book. This means either Mary's statement was incorrect, or the scenario presented contains a logical inconsistency. Regardless, the direct answer to whether Anthony read a book is no—he did not."

Here's why: Mary's statement is ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book."" This is a conditional statement where the dog playing is the antecedent (the ""if"" part) and Anthony reading a book is the consequent (the ""then"" part)[1].

Since we know the dog is **not** playing, the antecedent is false. In this case, the conditional statement tells us nothing about what actually happens[1]. The conditional only guarantees that Anthony will read a book **if** the dog is playing. Because the dog is not playing, we cannot use the conditional to conclude anything about Anthony's actions.

This is an example of the **fallacy of denying the antecedent**[1]. Just because the condition (the dog playing) was not met does not mean the outcome (Anthony reading) cannot occur. Anthony might read a book for completely different reasons—the conditional statement simply doesn't provide information about that scenario.

**Therefore, the answer is: No, it is not necessarily true that Anthony read a book, but it is also not necessarily false. The given information is insufficient to determine whether Anthony read a book.**"
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Yes, based on conditional reasoning logic, it is true that Amy brought donuts.

Here's why: Mary's statement creates a conditional relationship where the empty fridge is a **sufficient condition** for Amy bringing donuts[1]. The structure is:

If (fridge is empty) → (Amy brings donuts)

Since we know the antecedent (the ""if"" part) is true—the fridge IS empty—we can validly apply **modus ponens**[1]. This valid logical form states that ""an affirmation of the antecedent (or sufficient condition) results in the logically valid assertion of the consequent.""

In other words:
- Premise 1: If the fridge is empty, then Amy will bring donuts
- Premise 2: The fridge is empty (TRUE)
- Conclusion: Therefore, Amy brought donuts

This is a logically valid deduction. The only case where a conditional statement ""If p, then q"" is false is when p is true and q is false[3]. Since Mary made the statement and we've confirmed the fridge is empty, the consequent (Amy bringing donuts) must be true for her statement to hold."

However, this creates a logical inconsistency worth examining. According to Mary's conditional statement, ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts,"" we can apply the logical reasoning principle known as **modus ponens**[1]. Since the fridge is empty (the antecedent is true), the consequent should logically follow—meaning Amy should bring donuts[1].

Yet the facts tell us Amy did not bring donuts. This means either:

- Mary's statement was incorrect or inaccurate, or
- The scenario contains contradictory information

In formal conditional reasoning, a conditional statement ""If P, then Q"" only becomes false when P is true but Q is false[3]. That is exactly the situation here: the fridge is empty (P is true), but Amy did not bring donuts (Q is false), so Mary's conditional statement does not hold true in this scenario."

Mary's statement is a conditional in the form ""If P, then Q""[1]:
- **Antecedent (P)**: The fridge is empty
- **Consequent (Q)**: Amy will bring donuts

The actual fact is that **the fridge is full**, which means the antecedent is false. According to conditional logic, when the hypothesis/antecedent is false, the conditional statement is logically true regardless of whether the consequent is true or false[3].

In other words, Mary's conditional statement only tells us what *would* happen *if* the fridge were empty. Since the fridge is actually full, the conditional doesn't apply, and it provides no information about whether Amy brought donuts or not.

To know whether Amy brought donuts, you would need additional information beyond what Mary's conditional statement tells us."

B3C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La Llúcia no té set. Hi ha suc de poma al rebost. La Maria diu: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua  a la nevera"".

La Maria fa una declaració condicional: ""Si la Llúcia té set, hi ha aigua a la nevera"". Aquesta és una proposició del tipus ""Si P llavors Q"", on:

- P = La Llúcia té set
- Q = Hi ha aigua a la nevera

Sabem que P és **fals** (la Llúcia no té set). 

En lògica clàssica, quan el supòsit d'una declaració condicional és fals, la declaració en si és tècnicament vàlida (verdadera per vacuïtat), però això **no ens diu res sobre si Q és veritat o no**. La declaració de la Maria només ens garanteix que ""si la Llúcia tingués set, llavors hi hauria aigua"", però com que la Llúcia no té set, la declaració no ens proporciona informació sobre l'existència real d'aigua a la nevera.

Per tant, basant-nos únicament en allò que diu la Maria, **no podem concloure si hi ha aigua a la nevera o no**."

Allò que diu Maria és una afirmació condicional: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". En forma lògica, això és: *p* → *q*, on *p* és ""el mòbil no té bateria"" (vertader segons el context) i *q* és ""hi ha un carregador al calaix"" (fals segons el context).

Quan tenim una afirmació condicional amb antecedent vertader i conseqüent fals, la conclusió del condicional és falsa. En aquest cas, malgrat que la premissa de Maria (que el mòbil no té bateria) és correcta, la seva conclusió (que hi ha un carregador al calaix) és falsa perquè no hi ha cap carregador al calaix[1][2].

Això es pot determinar de dues formes:

**Directament del context**: El context estableix explícitament que ""hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"", per tant aquesta és una afirmació directa que es compleix.

**A través de la lògica de l'afirmació de Maria**: Maria diu que ""si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Aquesta és una proposició condicional (Si P → Q). Sabem que:
- El temps **és** plujós (afirmació del context)
- Maria afirma que quan el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer

Per tant, ja que la condició es compleix (el temps és plujós) i Maria afirma que la proposició condicional és certa, podem concloure que la conseqüència és veritable: hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer.

En conclusió, tant l'afirmació directa del context com el raonament lògic de la declaració de Maria confirmen que **sí, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer**."

El context que has proporcionat estableix explícitament que ""no hi ha cap paraigua al paraigüer"", cosa que contradiu la declaració condicional que fa la Maria.

## Anàlisi lògica

La Maria afirma: ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"", que és una proposició condicional de la forma: Si P llavors Q.

En aquest cas:
- **P** (antecedent): el temps és plujós - **CERT** (el context confirma que el temps és plujós)
- **Q** (conseqüent): hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer - **FALS** (el context confirma que NO hi ha paraigua)

Com que el temps és efectivament plujós (P és veritat) però no hi ha paraigua al paraigüer (Q és fals), la declaració condicional de la Maria es contradeix amb la realitat. Una proposició condicional només és veritable si, quan l'antecedent és cert, el conseqüent també ho és. En aquest cas no és així.

Per tant, **no només no és veritat que hi ha un paraigua**, sinó que la declaració de la Maria és **falsa** perquè l'antecedent és veritat però el conseqüent és fals."
B5C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El temps és serè. Hi ha un impermeable al cotxe. La Maria diu: ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer?","No es pot determinar si és veritat que hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer basant-se en la informació proporcionada.

La Maria ha fet una afirmació condicional: ""Si el temps és plujós, hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"". Això significa que quan plou, aleshores hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer. Tanmateix, en lògica, una declaració condicional només ens informa sobre el que passa quan es compleix la condició.

En aquest cas, el temps és serè (no plujós), per tant la condició de la declaració de la Maria no es compleix. Quan la condició no es compleix, la declaració condicional no ens permet arribar a cap conclusió sobre si hi ha o no un paraigua al paraigüer. Senzillament, la declaració de la Maria no ens dóna aquesta informació.

Per poder confirmar si hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer, hauríem de tenir informació directa sobre l'existència del paraigua, independent de la condició sobre el temps."
B6T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La roda del cotxe està punxada i hi ha un inflador al garatge. També hi ha una bicicleta a la porta d'entrada. La Maria diu: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","Sí, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge.

Segons el context proporcionat, es confirma explícitament que **""hi ha un inflador al garatge""**. A més, des d'una perspectiva lògica, podem arribar a aquesta conclusió a través del raonament que fa Maria.[3][4]

Maria presenta un **raonament condicional**: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, hi ha un inflador al garatge."" Aquesta és una implicació lògica de la forma: si P llavors Q, on P és ""la roda del cotxe està punxada"" i Q és ""hi ha un inflador al garatge"".[3]

En aquest cas:
- Sabem que P és **verdader** (la roda del cotxe està punxada)
- Aplicant la **conseqüència lògica** del raonament de Maria, deduïm que Q és **verdader**[4]

Per tant, tant del context directe com per deducció lògica, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge."
B6F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La roda del cotxe està punxada i no hi ha cap inflador al garatge. Tampoc no hi ha cap bicicleta a la porta d'entrada.

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","No, segons els fets del context proporcionat, **no és veritat que hi hagi un inflador al garatge**. El context indica explícitament que ""no hi ha cap inflador al garatge"".

L'afirmació de la Maria és una proposició condicional que es pot expressar com: ""Si P, aleshores Q"", on P és ""la roda del cotxe està punxada"" i Q és ""hi ha un inflador al garatge""[1].

Segons la lògica, aquesta proposició condicional és **falsa** perquè[1][2]:

- L'antecedent (P) és **vertader**: efectivament, la roda del cotxe està punxada
- El consequent (Q) és **fals**: no hi ha inflador al garatge
- Quan l'antecedent d'una condicional és vertader però el consequent és fals, la proposició completa és falsa

Per tant, l'afirmació de la Maria no es compleix amb la realitat descrita. Ella diu que si la roda està punxada, hi hauria d'haver un inflador al garatge, però malgrat que la roda efectivament està punxada, **no hi ha inflador**."

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un inflador al garatge?","No, no es pot afirmar amb certesa que hi ha un inflador al garatge basant-se només en el que diu la Maria.

La declaració de Maria és un condicional: ""Si la roda del cotxe està punxada, aleshores hi ha un inflador al garatge."" En lògica, aquest tipus d'enunciat (Si P, aleshores Q) només ens informa sobre allò que passa quan la condició P és certa.

En aquest cas:
- La condició (P) és: ""la roda del cotxe està punxada""
- La conclusió (Q) és: ""hi ha un inflador al garatge""

Sabem del context que **la roda del cotxe està inflada**, és a dir, que la condició NO es compleix (la roda NO està punxada). Quan una condició no es produeix, no podem extreure cap conclusió sobre la conseqüència mitjançant l'enunciat condicional de Maria.

Per tant, l'enunciat de Maria no ens diu res sobre si hi ha o no un inflador al garatge quan la roda no està punxada. Podria haver-hi un inflador al garatge per altres raons, o podria no hi hagi. Simplement, no tenim informació suficient per determinar-ho."

- **Afirmació de la Maria**: Falsa (ja que el condicionant és cert però la conseqüència és falsa)"

Dit d'una altra manera: el fet que la afirmació de la Maria sigui vàlida no significa que realment hi hagi una regadora a la prestatgeria. Podria haver-la o no. La proposició condicional no ens dona informació suficient per respondre aquesta pregunta.

Els homes mostren una preferència més marcada per la pizza (64%) en comparació amb les dones (52%), i la pizza és favorita tant en zones urbanes (66%) com rurals (52%)[1]. A més, la pizza és especialment popular al Midwest dels Estats Units, on assoleix un 67% de preferència[1].

Malgrat que, com menciones, la pasta és més barata i té una vida més llarga a la nevera, la pizza ha assolit un estatus de favoritisme popular a nivell general, possiblement degut al seu atractiu sensorial, la varietat de sabors i la seva associació amb reunions socials i celebracions[1]."

En el context específic que plantegeu, on es menciona que la majoria de gent prefereix el té verd malgrat que el cafè sigui més barat, la resposta seria que el té s'utilitza més que el cafè en aquesta situació particular.

Es poden preparar de diverses maneres: bullits, saltats, al forn, en guisats, en cremes i fins i tot crus[1][4]. A més, els bròquils destaquen nutricionalment com un ""superaliment""[4], amb un contingut elevat de vitamina C, fibra, proteïnes i altres nutrients importants[1][3].

Els nyoquis, per altra banda, són un plat més específic d'origen italoamericà[15] que requereix una preparació més senzilla en comparació, però que no s'utilitza amb la mateixa freqüència en la cuina quotidiana.

Els search results disponibles contenen principalment informació sobre receptes i propietats nutricionals del bròquil, fet que reflecteix la seva major presència i ús en la cuina general."
F5T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que el sushi és més saludable que les hamburgueses, la gent menja més sovint les hamburgueses. Hi ha sushi a la taula. En aquest context, les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi?","Sí, segons el context que has proporcionat, les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi perquè la gent les menja més sovint, a pesar que el sushi és més saludable.[1]

Els resultats de cerca confirmen aquesta tendència. Els estudis sobre entorns alimentaris urbans mostren que els establiments que venen hamburgueses i altres aliments hipercalòrics són més abundants i accessibles que els que ofereixen opcions més saludables.[2] Aquesta major disponibilitat i accessibilitat de les hamburgueses contribueix al seu consum més freqüent entre la població, especialment en contextos urbans com Barcelona.

Per altra banda, el sushi, tot que és una opció més nutritiva, té una menor penetració en els hàbits de consum quotidià, ja que sol estar associat amb restaurants més especialitzats i amb preus més elevats, cosa que limita la seva accessibilitat en comparació amb les hamburgueses."
F5F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que el sushi és més saludable que les hamburgueses, la gent menja més sovint les hamburgueses. Hi ha sushi a la taula. En aquest context, el sushi és més popular que les hamburgueses?","Segons el context que proporcionas, la resposta és **no**. El context estableix explícitament que ""la gent menja més sovint les hamburgueses"", la qual cosa indica que les hamburgueses són més populars que el sushi, malgrat que el sushi sigui més saludable.

Aquesta observació reflecteix un patró comú en l'alimentació: que la popularitat i la freqüència de consum d'un aliment no sempre correlacionan amb el seu valor nutricional. Tanmateix, els resultats de cerca disponibles no contenen dades estadístiques específiques sobre la popularitat comparativa del sushi versus les hamburgueses a nivell general que pugui complementar aquesta informació."
F6T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els plàtans són més cars que els kiwis, la gent els compra més. Hi ha platans al cabàs. En aquest context, els platans són més populars que els kiwis?","Sí, segons el context que proporciones, els plàtans són més populars que els kiwis. El fet que la gent compri més plàtans malgrat que siguin més cars que els kiwis és un indicador clar de major preferència i popularitat dels plàtans entre els consumidors. Aquesta disposició a pagar un preu més alt per als plàtans suggereix que els consumidors els valoren més o els prefereixen, la qual cosa reflecteix una major popularitat en el mercat en comparació amb els kiwis."
F6F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els plàtans són més cars que els kiwis, la gent els compra més. Hi ha platans al cabàs. En aquest context, els kiwis són més populars que els plàtans?","No, els kiwis no són més populars que els plàtans. De fet, és l'oposat. Segons el context que proporcioneu, tot i que els plàtans són més cars que els kiwis, la gent en compra més. Això demostra que els **plàtans són més populars** que els kiwis entre els consumidors, ja que les persones estan disposades a pagar preus més elevats per adquirir-los.

Aquesta preferència pels plàtans es manté fins i tot quan els seus preus augmenten significativament. Tal com s'indica en els resultats de cerca, els plàtans de Canàries han triplicat el seu preu en els últims mesos, però continuen sent els fruites més consumides a casa.[2][4] Aquesta demanda constant evidencia que els plàtans gaueixen de major popularitat que altres fruites com els kiwis entre la població."
F7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent els prefereix. Hi ha un gat pujat a l'arbre. En aquest context, els gossos són més populars que els gats?","La resposta és **matisada** i depèn de com es mesuri la popularitat.

## Per nombre de llars

Els gossos són més populars en termes de **llars amb mascotes**. Als Estats Units, un 31% de les llars posseïen gossos en comparació amb el 26% que posseïen gats[1]. A més, segons una enquesta nord-americana de 2007-2008, les llars propietàries de gossos eren superiors a les que posseïen gats[1]. El Regne Unit mostra una tendència similar, amb el 31% de les llars tenint gossos enfront del 26% amb gats[1].

## Per nombre total d'animals

Tot i això, el nombre **total de gats és superior al de gossos** als Estats Units. Hi ha aproximadament 86,4 milions de gats per a mascotes en comparació amb aproximadament 78,2 milions de gossos[1]. Aquesta tendència es repeteix en altres ciutadins dels EUA: el 2007-2008, tot i que més llars tenien gossos, el nombre total de mascotes gats era superior al dels gossos[1].

## Variacions per país

La popularitat també varia segons la regió. A la Xina, els residents posseeixen més gossos (51 milions) que gats (41 milions)[1]. A Itàlia, en canvi, hi ha més gats (7,5 milions) que gossos (7 milions)[1].

En conclusió, els gossos són més populars en termes de nombres de **llars** que els posseeixen, però els gats són més populars en termes del nombre **total** d'animals domèstics."
F7F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que els gossos són més alegres que els gats, la gent els prefereix. Hi ha un gat pujat a l'arbre. En aquest context, els gats són més populars que els gossos?","La resposta depèn de com es mesuri la popularitat. Segons les dades disponibles, el resultat és mixt:[1]

**Per nombre total de mascotes:** Sí, els gats són més populars als Estats Units. Hi ha aproximadament 86,4 milions de gats per a mascotes comparats amb aproximadament 78,2 milions de gossos. Això significa que, en total, la població de gats supera la dels gossos en aproximadament 8 milions.[1]

**Per percentatge de llars:** No, els gossos són més populars. Al Regne Unit, el 31% de les llars posseïen gossos mentre que només el 26% posseïen gats. Això indica que més famílies trien tenir un gos que un gat.[1]

**Internacionalment:** Els gossos són més populars a nivell global. A la Xina, els habitants posseeixen 51 milions de gossos en comparació amb 41 milions de gats. A Itàlia, la situació és similar amb 7,5 milions de gats i 7 milions de gossos, una diferència mínima.[1]

En resum, si ens fixem en el **nombre total de mascotes**, els gats surten per davant als Estats Units. Tanmateix, si considerem el **nombre de llars** que posseeixen cada animal o la situació **global**, els gossos són més populars. Els dos animals comparteixen una gran popularitat com a mascotes, però les preferències varien segons la regió i la manera de mesurar-la."
F8T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que llegir llibres és més educatiu que mirar la televisió, la majoria de les persones miren la televisió. Hi ha un llibre a la prestatgeria. En aquest context, hi ha més persones que miren la televisó que no pas que llegeixen llibres?","La informació proporcionada als resultats de cerca no permet fer una comparació directa entre el nombre de persones que miren la televisió i les que llegeixen llibres que sigui concluyent.

Els resultats mostren dades parcials: entre els adolescents españols, **el 37,5% mira la televisió amb freqüència**, mentre que el 62,5% no la mira amb freqüència[1]. Respecte a la lectura de llibres, es mencionen dades sobre la freqüència de lectura de la població de 16 anys i més a Catalunya del 2006[2], però aquestes no es presenten en format de percentatge comparable que permeti confrontar directament ambdues activitats.

El que sí es pot afirmar segons els resultats és que entre els joves, **el mòbil i la televisió són els dispositius més utilitzats**[3], però això no significa necessàriament que hi hagi més telespectadors que lectors en termes de percentatge poblacional global.

Per respondre adequadament a la pregunta, caldria tenir estadístiques comparables sobre la proporció de la població que mira televisió regularment enfront de la que llegeix llibres regularment, dada que no està clarament disponible als resultats proporcionats."
F8F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que llegir llibres és més educatiu que mirar la televisió, la majoria de les persones miren la televisió. Hi ha un llibre a la prestatgeria. En aquest context, hi ha més persones que llegeixen llibres que no pas que miren la televisió?","No, no hi ha més persones que llegeixen llibres que no pas que miren la televisió. Les dades mostren una diferència notable entre el consum de televisió i la lectura de llibres.

Segons els hàbits de lectura a Catalunya, entre el 62% i el 68% de la població llegeix durant el temps lliure.[2] En contrasta, el 90,8% de la gent mira televisió diàriament,[9] amb proporcions encara més altes en grups d'edat més gran, superant el 96% en persones de 55 a 64 anys.[3]

Aquesta diferència es fa especialment evident quan s'analitzen les raons per les quals la gent no llegeix. De les persones que no dediquen temps a la lectura, el 44,3% ho excusa per la falta de temps, però més de la meitat reconeix que prefereix dedicar el temps a altres entreteniments, específicament mirar televisió, navegar per internet, sortir i mirar sèries i pel·lícules.[2]

Per tant, tot i que la lectura és més educativa i beneficiosa per a l'empatia i l'èxit personal,[1] la televisió és sensiblement més consumida que la lectura de llibres a la població en general."
F9T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que córrer és millor per a la salut que caminar, la majoria de la gent prefereix caminar. Hi ha un corredor a la pista. En aquest context, caminar és més popular que córrer?","Sí, caminar és més popular que córrer. Segons les dades de l'enquesta d'hàbits esportius de la població adulta de Barcelona del 2017, caminar com a exercici físic és l'activitat més practicada amb un 30,3% de la població, mentre que córrer pel carrer ocupa la tercera posició amb només un 16,5%[3].

Això es reflecteix en la preferència general de les persones per les activitats de menor impacte. Caminar és especialment atractiu per a moltes persones perquè és una activitat de molt baix impacte, ideal per a aquelles que tenen sobrepès, problemes de genolls o diverses tipus de lesions, ja que sempre hi ha un peu recolzant al sòl i no es pateixen els impactes grans que comporta córrer[1].

A més, el 60% de les persones que caminen com a exercici físic no combinen aquesta activitat amb cap altra, cosa que demostra que és una activitat suficientment satisfactòria per si sola[3]."
F9F,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que córrer és millor per a la salut que caminar, la majoria de la gent prefereix caminar. Hi ha un corredor a la pista. En aquest context, córrer és més popular que caminar?","No, córrer no és més popular que caminar. De fet, tot i els beneficis per a la salut que comporta córrer, la majoria de la gent prefereix caminar, tal com s'indica en el context proporcionat.

Però val la pena destacar que, en alguns contextos específics, la participació en activitats de córrer ha experimentat canvis interessants. A Catalunya, per exemple, mentre que algunes curses han vist disminuir la participació en comparació amb anys anteriors, el nombre total de curses ha augmentat significativament i cada vegada hi ha més gent que corre, especialment dones[3].

La preferència per caminar entre la majoria de la població pot estar relacionada amb diversos factors: caminar és una activitat de baix impacte, ideal per a persones amb sobrepès, problemes de rodilles o lesions, ja que sempre hi ha un peu recolzat al terra, evitant els impactes intensos del córrer[1]. A més, caminar és més accessible i fàcil d'incorporar a la rutina diària de la majoria de persones, cosa que explica per què, tot i que científicament córrer pot oferir beneficis comparables en menys temps, la gent en general tria caminar com a activitat física preferida."
S1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El lloro és a la gàbia. A més, el gos és a la gossera. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza?","Sí, és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza, segons la lògica del que diu la Maria.

Aquí és per què:

Maria va fer una afirmació condicional: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, el Tomàs portarà pizza"". Es tracta d'una proposició de la forma ""Si P, aleshores Q"", on:
- **P** = El lloro és a la gàbia
- **Q** = El Tomàs portarà pizza

Sabem que el **P és veritat**: el lloro IS a la gàbia (és una dada donada).

Quan tenim una proposició condicional (Si P, aleshores Q) que és certa, i sabem que P és certa, aleshores per lògica **Q també ha de ser certa**. Això s'anomena ""modus ponens"" en lògica formal.

Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria i atès que la condició s'ha complert, **sí que és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza**."

Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza?","No, no podem concloure que sigui veritat que el Tomàs ha portat pizza només basant-nos en la informació proporcionada.

## Explicació lògica

L'afirmació de la Maria és una proposició condicional: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia, llavors el Tomàs portarà pizza"". En lògica, aquesta estructura és:

**Si P, allavors Q**

On:
- P = ""el lloro és a la gàbia""
- Q = ""el Tomàs portarà pizza""

El que sabem és que **P és fals** (el lloro no és a la gàbia).

## Per què no podem concloure res?

Quan una proposició condicional té l'antecedent (la primera part) fals, no podem deduir res sobre la conseqüència (la segona part). La proposició condicional de la Maria només ens indica quin hauria de ser el resultat **si** el lloro estés a la gàbia, però ja que el lloro **no** està a la gàbia, la condició no es compleix i no tenim informació sobre si el Tomàs ha portat pizza o no.

Per tant, la resposta és que **no sabem si el Tomàs ha portat pizza**. No és veritat que puguem afirmar-ho amb certesa basant-nos únicament en les dades donades."

Maria va formular una promesa condicional: ""Si t'acabes els bròquils, el Marc et donarà un caramel"". Ja que tu t'has acabat els bròquils (la condició s'ha complert), la conclusió lògica de la seva declaració és que el Marc hauria de donar-te el caramel.

**Antecedent:** La televisió està engegada (VERITAT)
**Conseqüent:** El Mateu farà galetes (FALS - perquè Mateu no ha fet galetes)

En lògica proposicional, un condicional (si... aleshores...) es declara **fals** només quan l'antecedent és veritat i el conseqüent és fals. En aquest cas, tenim exactament aquesta situació.[1][2]

Això significa que l'enunciat de Maria ""Si la televisió està engegada, el Mateu farà galetes"" és **lògicament fals** o és una predicció que s'ha complert erròniament.

## Conclusió

A la pregunta directa: **No, no és veritat que el Mateu ha fet galetes**, perquè el context explícitament ens diu que no les ha fet. Però simultàniament, la declaració condicional de Maria crea una contradicció lògica, ja que la televisió està engegada però Mateu no ha complert l'acció predicha."
S4C,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La televisió està apagada. La ràdio també està apagada. La Maria havia dit: ""Si la televisió està engegada, el Mateu farà galetes"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que el Mateu ha fet galetes?","No, no podem concloure que el Mateu ha fet galetes.

La Maria va fer una declaració condicional: ""Si la televisió està engegada, el Mateu farà galetes"". Això significa que la promesa del Mateu fent galetes només es compleix quan la televisió està engegada.

Ja que la televisió està apagada (la condició no es compleix), la declaració de la Maria no ens proporciona cap informació sobre si el Mateu ha fet galetes o no. La promesa estava condicionada a una situació que no es dona, per tant no podem afirmar que el Mateu ha fet galetes basant-nos només en allò que va dir la Maria."

S7T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: La gespa ha estat tallada. A més, les flors també han estat regades. La Maria havia dit: ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"".

Encara que Maria va dir que ""Si el Pau talla la gespa, rebrà 50 euros"", la informació del context presenta dues limitacions:

1. **No sabem qui va tallar la gespa**: El context només indica que ""la gespa ha estat tallada"", però no especifica que vaja ser el Pau qui ho va fer. Per tant, la condició que Maria va establir podria no complir-se.

2. **No tenim confirmació del pagament**: Inclús si assumim que el Pau va tallar la gespa, no tenim informació que confirme que Maria li va pagar els 50 euros. El context només ens comunica la promesa condicional de Maria, però no el resultat final del pagament.

Per concloure que el Pau ha rebut els 50 euros, necessitaríem confirmació de que tant el Pau va tallar la gespa com que Maria va efectuar el pagament."

Malgrat que Maria va dir que si el Pau tallava la gespa rebria 50 euros, i que la gespa ha estat tallada, el context estableix com a fet que el Pau no ha rebut aquesta quantitat. Per tant, la resposta a la pregunta és directa: **No**.

Hi ha una possible inconsistència o paradoxa en aquesta situació - la gespa ha estat tallada però el Pau no ha rebut la recompensa que Maria va prometre - però la pregunta simplement demana si és veritat que el Pau ha rebut 50 euros, i la resposta segons el context donat és clarament negativa."

La Maria va fer un statement lògic: ""Si el gos està jugant, l'Antoni llegirà un llibre"". Això vol dir que el gos jugant és la condició perquè l'Antoni llegeixi un llibre.

Com que **el gos està jugant** (és una afirmació certa segons el context), es compleix la condició establerta per la Maria. Per tant, segons aquesta afirmació condicional, **l'Antoni llegirà un llibre** (o ha llegit un llibre).

Aquesta és una aplicació del principi lògic de **modus ponens**: si tenim una implicació (Si A, aleshores B) i sabem que A és cert, llavors B ha de ser cert necessàriament."

Tenint en compte que el gos efectivament està jugant, aplicant la regla de **modus ponens** descrita als estudis de lògica proposicional[2], si el condicional fos vertader i l'antecedent (el gos està jugant) és vertader, aleshores el conseqüent (l'Antoni llegirà un llibre) hauria de ser necessàriament vertader.

No obstant això, la realitat del context contradiu aquesta previsió: l'Antoni no ha llegit cap llibre.

En aquest cas:
- P (la nevera està buida) = **cert**

Això significa que la declaració condicional de la Maria no s'ha complert. Si la seva afirmació fos veritable, aleshores quan la nevera estés buida, l'Anna hauria d'haver portat donuts. Tanmateix, tot i que la nevera està buida, l'Anna no ha portat donuts.

B1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni ha fame e c'è della pizza in forno. C'è anche della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","Sì, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno.

Questa conclusione deriva da due fonti:

**Dal contesto dato:** Nel contesto iniziale è esplicitamente affermato che ""c'è della pizza in forno"", quindi questo è un fatto già stabilito.

**Dalla logica condizionale:** Maria formula un'affermazione della forma ""Se A, allora B"", dove:
- A = Gianni ha fame
- B = c'è della pizza in forno

Poiché il contesto confirma che Gianni ha fame (la premessa A è vera) e Maria ha stabilito che se Gianni ha fame allora c'è pizza in forno, applicando il principio logico del *modus ponens*, possiamo necessariamente concludere che B è vero, cioè che c'è della pizza in forno."
B1F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni ha fame e non c'è della pizza in forno. Non c'è nemmeno della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No, non è vero che c'è della pizza in forno. Infatti, il contesto esplicita chiaramente: ""Gianni ha fame e non c'è della pizza in forno.""

Quello che possiamo dedurre logicamente è che **la dichiarazione di Maria è falsa**. Analizziamo il ragionamento:

Maria afferma: ""Se Gianni ha fame, allora c'è della pizza in forno"" (Se P, allora Q)

Sappiamo che:
- P è vero: Gianni ha fame ✓
- Q è falso: Non c'è della pizza in forno ✗

Quando l'antecedente di un'affermazione condizionale (Se P allora Q) è vero, ma la conseguenza è falsa, allora l'intera affermazione è falsa. In questo caso, Maria dice qualcosa che non corrisponde alla realtà: sebbene Gianni abbia fame, non c'è pizza in forno, quindi la sua implicazione logica non regge.

La risposta alla domanda è quindi: **No, non è vero che c'è della pizza in forno**, ed inoltre **l'affermazione di Maria risulta essere contraddetta dai fatti**."
B1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni non ha fame. C'è della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No, non è possibile affermare con certezza che c'è della pizza in forno sulla base di ciò che dice Maria.

## Analisi logica dell'affermazione

L'affermazione di Maria è un **condizionale della forma P → Q**, dove:
- **P** = ""Gianni ha fame"" (FALSO, poiché Gianni non ha fame)
- **Q** = ""C'è della pizza in forno"" (SCONOSCIUTO)

In logica classica, un enunciato condizionale è falso solo nel caso in cui l'antecedente sia vero e il conseguente sia falso[1][3]. In tutti gli altri casi, incluso quando l'antecedente è falso, il condizionale risulta vero.

## Implicazione per la pizza

Poiché Gianni **non ha fame** (l'antecedente è falso), il condizionale affermato da Maria è automaticamente vero, indipendentemente dal fatto che ci sia o meno pizza nel forno[1]. 

Quando l'antecedente di un condizionale è falso, non possiamo dedurre alcunché sul conseguente. La pizza nel forno potrebbe esserci oppure no: il condizionale rimane vero in entrambi i casi.

Pertanto, l'affermazione di Maria non fornisce informazioni concrete sulla presenza della pizza nel forno. Per saperlo con certezza, dovresti verificare direttamente nel forno, non basarti su questa affermazione condizionale."

Un'inferenza è valida quando la conclusione segue necessariamente dalle premesse[7].

L'affermazione di Maria risulta essere **falsa**. Un'affermazione condizionale è falsa solo quando l'antecedente è vero e il conseguente è falso, che è esattamente quello che accade in questo caso.

Dal contesto sappiamo che il telefono di Pietro è effettivamente scarico. Applicando la regola logica del modus ponens (se ""Se A allora B"" è vera e A è vera, allora B deve essere vera), possiamo dedurre con certezza che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto."

Applicando il **Modus Ponens**[2], una delle regole di inferenza più note, se la premessa ""il telefono è scarico"" (A) è vera e l'implicazione ""Se A allora B"" fosse vera, allora dovrebbe essere vera anche la conclusione B (""c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"").

Tuttavia, il contesto stabilisce chiaramente che:

Questa situazione viola la validità del Modus Ponens. Poiché A è vero ma B è falso, l'affermazione di Maria (A → B) non può essere corretta. L'implicazione sarebbe falsa perché non rispetta la struttura logica necessaria per mantenere la verità[5].

Tuttavia, sappiamo dal contesto che il telefono di Pietro **è carico**, non scarico. Poiché la condizione (""il telefono è scarico"") non è verificata, non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione certa sull'esistenza del caricatore nel cassetto.

Basandoci su quello che dice Maria, possiamo applicare una semplice regola di inferenza logica: il **modus ponens**[1]. Maria afferma un condizionale: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". Sappiamo dal contesto che il tempo è effettivamente piovoso. Pertanto, dalla premessa condizionale di Maria e dal fatto che la condizione (il tempo piovoso) è verificata, possiamo validamente concludere che conseguente è vero: c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli[1].

Il contesto stabilisce chiaramente che non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli, quindi la risposta è definitivamente negativa.

## Analisi del ragionamento condizionale

La dichiarazione di Maria rappresenta un **enunciato condizionale** della forma A → B[1], dove:

- **A** (antecedente): ""il tempo è piovoso"" → vera
- **B** (conseguente): ""c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"" → falsa

## Applicazione del Modus Tollens

In questa situazione possiamo applicare il **Modus Tollens**, una regola di inferenza valida[2]. Questo schema logico permette di dedurre che dalla negazione del conseguente di un enunciato condizionale ne consegue la negazione dell'antecedente[2].

Sappiamo che:
- Il condizionale di Maria è: se A allora B
- B è falso (non c'è ombrello nel portaombrelli)
- Quindi, per il Modus Tollens, l'enunciato di Maria deve essere falso

In altre parole, poiché sappiamo per certo che non esiste un ombrello nel portaombrelli (B è falso), e Maria afferma che se piove allora c'è un ombrello, la sua dichiarazione risulta logicamente contraddetta dai fatti. L'enunciato condizionale di Maria non corrisponde alla realtà: il tempo è piovoso (A è vero), ma non c'è un ombrello (B è falso), il che rende il condizionale falso."
B5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è sereno. C'è un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No, non è possibile determinare con certezza se c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli basandosi unicamente su quello che dice Maria.

Maria ha enunciato un'affermazione condizionale: ""**Se il tempo è piovoso, allora c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli**"". Questa può essere rappresentata come: Tempo piovoso → Ombrello nel portaombrelli.

Tuttavia, sappiamo che **il tempo è sereno** (non piovoso). In una proposizione condizionale, quando l'antecedente (la parte ""se"") è falsa, non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione certa sulla conseguente (la parte ""allora""). 

Una proposizione condizionale ""Se P allora Q"" ci garantisce che Q sia vera solo quando P è vera. Nel nostro caso, poiché il tempo non è piovoso (P è falso), la proposizione di Maria non ci fornisce informazioni sul fatto che l'ombrello sia effettivamente nel portaombrelli. L'ombrello potrebbe esserci oppure no: l'affermazione di Maria semplicemente non lo specifica.

Per poter dedurre che esiste l'ombrello nel portaombrelli, avremmo avuto bisogno che il tempo fosse piovoso, cosicché potessimo applicare il principio logico del Modus Ponens (se P è vero e ""P implica Q"" è vero, allora Q è vero). Ma in questo caso, il presupposto non è soddisfatto."

Sì, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage. Questo può essere dimostrato attraverso un ragionamento logico valido.

## La Struttura dell'Inferenza

- A = la gomma della macchina è a terra (VERO, secondo il contesto)
- B = c'è una pompa in garage (da determinare)

## L'Applicazione del Modus Ponens

Dal contesto sappiamo che la prima condizione è soddisfatta: la gomma della macchina è effettivamente a terra. Quando applichiamo la regola del **Modus Ponens** (una delle regole di inferenza fondamentali del calcolo proposizionale)[4], possiamo dedurre che la conclusione deve essere vera.

Il Modus Ponens funziona secondo questo schema:
- Premessa 1: Se A, allora B
- Premessa 2: A è vero
- Conclusione: B è vero

Poiché entrambe le premesse sono soddisfatte (Maria afferma la relazione condizionale e sappiamo che la gomma è a terra), possiamo validamente concludere che c'è una pompa in garage[2][5].

## Conclusione

Per quanto riguarda ciò che Maria dice, l'inferenza è corretta e la conclusione è logicamente valida: è vero che c'è una pompa in garage."
B6F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e non c'è nessuna pompa in garage. Non c'è nemmeno una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No, non è vero che c'è una pompa in garage.

Nel contesto fornito, ti viene esplicitamente detto che ""Non c'è nessuna pompa in garage"". Questo è un fatto diretto e oggettivo.

Riguardo a quello che dice Maria, la sua affermazione è una proposizione logica condizionale: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, allora c'è una pompa in garage"" (Se P, allora Q).

Sappiamo che:
- La condizione è vera: la gomma della macchina **è** a terra (P è vero)
- La conseguenza è falsa: **non c'è** una pompa in garage (Q è falso)

Quando una proposizione condizionale ha una premessa vera ma una conclusione falsa, la proposizione stessa è falsa. Quindi Maria sta dicendo qualcosa che non è vero.

La risposta alla domanda rimane comunque: **no, non c'è una pompa in garage**, come stabilito chiaramente nel contesto iniziale."
B6C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è gonfia. C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No, non è possibile determinare dalla dichiarazione di Maria se c'è veramente una pompa in garage.

Maria ha formulato un'affermazione condizionale: ""**Se** la gomma della macchina è a terra, **allora** c'è una pompa in garage"". Questo è un enunciato del tipo ""Se P, allora Q"".

Nel vostro contesto, la gomma è **gonfia**, non a terra. Quindi la condizione (P) su cui si basa il ragionamento di Maria è falsa. Quando la premessa di un condizionale è falsa, l'affermazione di Maria non ci dice nulla sulla verità o falsità della conseguenza (Q - l'esistenza della pompa). 

La dichiarazione di Maria rimane logicamente valida anche se non c'è pompa in garage, poiché il condizionale non viene mai attivato (la gomma non è a terra). Per sapere se c'è davvero una pompa in garage, avreste bisogno di informazioni dirette, non da questa affermazione ipotetica."
B7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. C'è anche un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino.

Secondo il contesto fornito all'inizio della domanda, viene esplicitamente dichiarato che ""c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". Questa è un'informazione data come fatto già stabilito.

Inoltre, da un punto di vista logico:
- Maria afferma: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale""
- Sappiamo che la pianta è effettivamente secca
- Sappiamo dal contesto che l'annaffiatoio è presente sullo scaffale

Pertanto, l'affermazione di Maria è coerente con la realtà descritta nel contesto, e la risposta alla domanda è affermativa."
B7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"".

Secondo il contesto fornito, è esplicitamente dichiarato che ""non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". Questo è un fatto già stabilito.

Dalla prospettiva logica, l'affermazione di Maria (""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"") risulta **falsa**. Ecco perché:

- **La pianta è effettivamente secca** (la premessa dell'affermazione condizionale di Maria è vera)
- **Non c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale** (la conclusione dell'affermazione di Maria è falsa)

Quando la premessa di un'affermazione condizionale ""Se A, allora B"" è vera ma la conclusione è falsa, l'intera affermazione condizionale è falsa. Pertanto, Maria si sbaglia: la sua affermazione non corrisponde alla realtà dei fatti."
B7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è rigogliosa. C'è un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No, non si può determinare se c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale basandosi unicamente su quello che dice Maria.

La frase di Maria è un'affermazione condizionale: ""**Se** la pianta è secca, **allora** c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". Tuttavia, sappiamo che la pianta è rigogliosa, il che significa che la condizione (""se la pianta è secca"") è **falsa**.

Nella logica, quando la condizione di un'affermazione ""se...allora"" è falsa, non possiamo trarre conclusioni sulla conseguenza. L'affermazione di Maria potrebbe essere vera in diversi scenari:

- La pianta non è secca E c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale
- La pianta non è secca E NON c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale

Entrambi gli scenari sono compatibili con quello che dice Maria. Per sapere se c'è effettivamente un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale, avremmo bisogno di informazioni aggiuntive oltre a quella dichiarazione condizionale."
B8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. C'è anche un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","Sì, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Questo può essere concluso applicando una regola di inferenza logica valida.

Nel caso descritto, Maria formula un'affermazione condizionale: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". Sappiamo inoltre che la camicia di Giorgio è effettivamente stropicciata. Di conseguenza, è possibile derivare una conclusione certa mediante il **Modus Ponens**, una regola di inferenza deduttiva[4].

L'inferenza logica è un processo di ragionamento in cui, partendo da una o più premesse, si giunge a una conclusione[2]. In questo caso le premesse sono:

1. La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata (premessa vera)
2. Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio (affermazione di Maria)

Applicando il Modus Ponens, poiché la prima parte della proposizione condizionale è vera (la camicia è stropicciata), anche la conclusione deve necessariamente essere vera (c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio)[4].

Una deduzione è valida quando è impossibile che le premesse siano vere e la conclusione falsa[2]. Nel vostro caso, dato che sappiamo che la camicia è stropicciata e Maria ha affermato la relazione condizionale, la conclusione che esiste un ferro da stiro nell'armadio segue logicamente e necessariamente dalle premesse."
B8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non c'è nemmeno un'asse da stiro in balcone.

Anzi, sappiamo con certezza che **non c'è**, come indicato esplicitamente nel contesto.

## Analisi logica

L'affermazione di Maria costituisce un'implicazione logica: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"" (che possiamo scrivere come A → B)[2].

Per applicare il **modus ponens** (la regola di inferenza più comune)[1], avremmo bisogno di:
- La premessa ""Se A allora B"" (A → B)
- La premessa che A è vero
- Da cui dedurremmo che B è vero

Nel nostro caso:
- A = ""La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata"" (VERO)
- B = ""C'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"" (FALSO)

Poiché sappiamo che A è vero ma B è falso, l'implicazione di Maria (A → B) è **logicamente falsa**. Una regola di inferenza valida deve preservare la verità[5]: se le premesse sono vere, anche la conclusione deve essere vera. In questo caso, l'affermazione di Maria non rispetta questa proprietà fondamentale.

Quindi, concludendo: l'affermazione di Maria è scorretta, e la verità dei fatti rimane che **non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio**."
B8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stirata. C'è un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","Non è possibile determinare con certezza se c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio basandosi solo su quello che dice Maria.

L'affermazione di Maria è un'implicazione logica: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In altre parole: Se P allora Q, dove P = ""la camicia è stropicciata"" e Q = ""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"".

Tuttavia, sappiamo che la camicia di Giorgio **non è stropicciata** - è stirata. Questo significa che la condizione P è falsa.

In logica, quando una condizione ""Se P allora Q"" ha un antecedente (P) che è falso, non possiamo concludere nulla sulla verità del conseguente (Q). L'implicazione rimane valida sia che Q sia vero che falso.

Quindi, il fatto che la camicia sia già stirata non ci fornisce alcuna informazione sul fatto che esista un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. L'affermazione di Maria non ci permette di determinarlo.

È vero che c'è un'asse da stiro in balcone, ma questo non ci dice nulla sulla presenza di un ferro da stiro nell'armadio - sono due fatti indipendenti."
B9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. C'è anche un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","Sì, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. Questa informazione è già fornita direttamente nel contesto iniziale, che esplicitamente afferma: ""Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale.""

La dichiarazione di Maria (""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"") è una proposizione condizionale (se-allora), ma il contesto già stabilisce come fatto che sia Susanna vuole leggere sia che ci sono libri sullo scaffale. Quindi, indipendentemente da ciò che Maria dice, la risposta alla domanda è affermativa: sì, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale."
B9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e non ci sono libri sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un giornale sul divano.

- Susanna vuole leggere (la condizione è **vera**)
- Ma non ci sono libri sullo scaffale (la conseguenza è **falsa**)

La proposizione condizionale di Maria risulta essere falsa. In una implicazione logica, quando l'antecedente (la premessa) è vero e il conseguente (la conclusione) è falso, l'intera proposizione è falsa.

Pertanto, la realtà è che **non ci sono libri sullo scaffale**, in contraddizione con quello che Maria afferma."
B9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna non vuole leggere. C'è un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","No, non è possibile determinare con certezza se è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale sulla base di quello che dice Maria.

In logica, quando un'affermazione condizionale ha un antecedente falso, **non possiamo concludere nulla sulla conseguenza**. L'affermazione condizionale di Maria ci dice cosa sarebbe vero se Susanna volesse leggere, ma poiché Susanna non vuole leggere, l'affermazione non fornisce alcuna informazione su quanto sia vero o falso che ci siano libri sullo scaffale.

In altre parole, i libri potrebbero essere lì o potrebbero non esserci—l'affermazione di Maria non ci permette di saperlo."
F1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante la pizza sia più cara della pasta, la gente la compra di più. C'è della pizza in frigo. In questo contesto, la pizza è più popolare della pasta?","No, la pasta è **più popolare della pizza**, non il contrario.

Secondo i dati disponibili, la pasta supera chiaramente la pizza in termini di popolarità. In un confronto diretto tra i due alimenti, la pasta ha ottenuto significativamente più menzioni e interazioni rispetto alla pizza, battendola nettamente nel gradimento generale[9].

A livello di orgoglio nazionale italiano, la situazione è ancora più marcata: la pasta rende gli italiani fieri di esserlo con un tasso del 45%, superando non solo la pizza (che non viene nemmeno citata in questa classifica), ma anche la musica (39%), l'opera lirica (36%) e lo sport (27,3%)[1].

Se analizziamo i piatti più amati dagli italiani per regione, troviamo un ampio dominio di preparazioni a base di pasta: tortellini in Emilia Romagna, arancini in Sicilia, pasta alla norma nelle isole, e numerosi altri piatti di pasta in diverse aree geografiche[3][5]. Questo conferma che la pasta, in tutte le sue varianti regionali, rimane il primo piatto della cucina italiana e il più apprezzato dalla popolazione.

Quindi, nonostante il contesto suggerisca comportamenti di acquisto diversi, i dati sulla popolarità indicano chiaramente che la pasta prevale sulla pizza."
F1F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante la pizza sia più cara della pasta, la gente la compra di più. C'è della pizza in frigo. In questo contesto, la pasta è più popolare della pizza?","No, la pasta non è più popolare della pizza. Al contrario, **la pizza è nettamente più popolare della pasta** negli Stati Uniti. Uno studio di CivicScience con oltre 19.000 intervistati rivela che il **62% delle persone sceglie la pizza rispetto alla pasta**, lasciando alla pasta solo il 38% delle preferenze[1]. Un sondaggio più recente confermò questa tendenza, con il 61% che sceglie la pizza e il 39% che opta per la pasta[7].

Questa preferenza per la pizza rimane **coerente tra i diversi gruppi di età**, con gli adulti di mezza età (30-64 anni) che mostrano la preferenza più forte verso la pizza al 62-63%, mentre i giovani adulti (18-29 anni) sono più equidistribuiti al 55% pizza contro 45% pasta[1].

Inoltre, gli uomini preferiscono ancora più chiaramente la pizza rispetto alle donne, con il 64% degli uomini che sceglie la pizza rispetto al 52% delle donne[1]."
F2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante il caffè sia più economico del tè verde, la maggior parte delle persone preferisce il tè verde. C'è del caffè nella moka. In questo contesto, il tè verde è usato più del caffè?","Non è supportato dai risultati disponibili che il tè verde sia usato più del caffè. Infatti, l'evidenza suggerisce il contrario.[1][2]

Il caffè rimane una bevanda estremamente popolare, soprattutto al mattino, poiché agisce più velocemente come stimolante e aiuta a migliorare la concentrazione.[2] Il caffè contiene generalmente tra 90-100 mg di caffeina per porzione, molto più rispetto ai circa 40-50 mg del tè verde per tazza standard.[1][8] Questo lo rende la scelta preferita da chi cerca un'energia rapida e immediata.

Tuttavia, entrambe le bevande hanno una base di consumatori solida con motivazioni diverse. Il tè verde è apprezzato da chi preferisce un rilascio di energia più graduale e duraturo, grazie alla presenza di L-teanina, un rilassante naturale.[5] Inoltre, il tè verde offre importanti benefici per la salute, con studi che dimostrano una riduzione della mortalità fino al 40% per chi ne consuma almeno 4 tazze al giorno.[3]

La scelta tra le due bevande dipende quindi più dalle preferenze personali, dagli effetti desiderati e dai benefici ricercati piuttosto da un'effettiva prevalenza d'uso di una sull'altra. Non esiste evidenza nei risultati disponibili che dimostri un uso generale più diffuso del tè verde rispetto al caffè a livello globale o locale."
F2F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante il caffè sia più economico del tè verde, la maggior parte delle persone preferisce il tè verde. C'è del caffè nella moka.

F3T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante l'acqua sia più sana delle bibite gassate, molti scelgono le bibite gassate. C'è dell'acqua in freezer. In questo contesto, le bibite gassate sono più richieste dell'acqua?","No, le bibite gassate non sono più richieste dell'acqua. I dati mostrano una tendenza opposta, con gli italiani che privilegiano l'acqua rispetto alle bibite zuccherate.

L'acqua si conferma come la bevanda più consumata, con il 57,4% degli intervistati che dichiara un aumento nel consumo negli ultimi anni[1][3]. Questo trend è particolarmente marcato tra i giovani dai 18 ai 34 anni (59,3%) e tra le donne (58,8%), con le percentuali più alte al Sud Italia (65,9%)[1][3].

Al contrario, le bevande zuccherate sono in netto calo. Il 39% degli italiani dichiara di aver ridotto il consumo di bevande zuccherate e gassate, segnale di una scelta più consapevole verso opzioni più salutari[1][3]. Questa tendenza si riflette anche nei dati di mercato: nel 2024 le vendite di bibite gassate hanno registrato un calo del 4%, con i volumi complessivi delle bibite analcoliche diminuiti dell'1,9%[5].

L'Italia inoltre presenta il consumo pro capite di bevande analcoliche più basso in Europa, attestandosi a soli 53-54 litri annui[5][7]. Inoltre, 8 italiani su 10 bevono bibite analcoliche solo occasionalmente e in misura di 1-2 bicchieri[8].

Il quadro generale riflette un trend globale verso un'idratazione maggiormente consapevole, dove gli italiani di tutte le generazioni stanno optando per scelte più salutistiche, prediligendo l'acqua e incrementando il consumo di tisane e infusi[1][3]."
F3F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante l'acqua sia più sana delle bibite gassate, molti scelgono le bibite gassate. C'è dell'acqua in freezer. In questo contesto, l'acqua è più richiesta delle bibite gassate?","Sì, l'acqua è attualmente più richiesta delle bibite gassate. Questo rappresenta un cambiamento significativo nelle preferenze dei consumatori negli ultimi anni.

Negli Stati Uniti, il sorpasso è avvenuto intorno al 2016, quando il consumo pro-capite di acqua in bottiglia ha superato quello delle bibite gassate.[1] Nel 2018, il divario si era ulteriormente ampliato: il consumo pro-capite di acqua in bottiglia ha raggiunto i 42 galloni annui (159 litri), mentre l'assunzione media di bevande gassate è scesa a circa 37 galloni (140 litri).[1] L'acqua confezionata si è consolidata come la bevanda più consumata negli Stati Uniti.[1]

Questo rappresenta un'inversione rispetto al passato. All'inizio del 2000, il consumo di soft drink pro-capite superava regolarmente i 50 galloni annui.[1] Il cambiamento è stato guidato da una preferenza dei consumatori per forme di reidratazione più salutari, con molti che cercano di evitare le calorie e i dolcificanti artificiali presenti nelle bevande gassate.[1] Inoltre, l'acqua in bottiglia portatile ed economica si è dimostrata perfettamente adattata alle diverse occasioni di consumo durante la giornata.[1]

In Europa, i dati confermano un consumo inferiore di bevande zuccherate, con il 66% degli europei che dichiara di non berle mai o con frequenza occasionale.[3] A livello globale, l'Italia si distingue come il terzo paese al mondo per consumo di acqua minerale in bottiglia, dopo Messico e Thailandia.[5]"

F5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante il sushi sia più sano degli hamburger, la gente mangia più spesso gli hamburger. C'è del sushi sul tavolo. In questo contesto, gli hamburger sono più popolari del sushi?","No, non è completamente accurato. I dati disponibili mostrano un quadro più sfumato sulla popularità relativa tra hamburger e sushi in Italia.

Secondo l'analisi di Yelp sui piatti più ricercati in Italia, il sushi occupa il **primo posto** nella Top 10, mentre l'hamburger si posiziona al **terzo posto**, dopo la pizza[3]. Questo suggerisce che il sushi ha effettivamente una maggiore visibilità in termini di ricerche e interesse online.

Tuttavia, quando si guarda ai dati specifici del food delivery, la situazione è leggermente diversa. Secondo i dati YouGov, gli hamburger da ristoranti/steakhouse vengono ordinati dal 28% degli utenti, mentre il sushi raggiunge il 21%[9]. Questo indica che, in termini di ordini effettivi a domicilio, gli hamburger hanno una penetrazione leggermente maggiore.

Inoltre, secondo Just Eat, il consumo di sushi ha raggiunto livelli straordinari nei primi mesi del 2024, e nel 2023 sono stati ordinati più di 1 milione di chili di sushi in Italia[1]. Nel 2023, il sushi si collocava al terzo posto nelle preferenze culinarie italiane, subito dopo pizza e hamburger[1].

In conclusione, non è corretto affermare che gli hamburger siano più popolari del sushi. Piuttosto, il sushi genera più interesse di ricerca e curiosità, anche se gli hamburger mantengono una quota leggermente più alta negli ordini effettivi di food delivery. Entrambi rimangono piatti molto apprezzati dagli italiani, con il sushi in crescente popolarità."
F5F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante il sushi sia più sano degli hamburger, la gente mangia più spesso gli hamburger. C'è del sushi sul tavolo. In questo contesto,il sushi è più popolare degli hamburger?","No, gli hamburger sono più popolari del sushi quando si considera il consumo effettivo, anche se sushi ottiene risultati migliori nelle ricerche online.

## Preferenze di ricerca vs. ordini effettivi

Secondo i dati Yelp sulle ricerche in Italia, il sushi si posiziona al primo posto della classifica generale,[1] mentre gli hamburger occupano il terzo posto.[1] Tuttavia, quando si esaminano gli ordini effettivi di cibo da asporto, la situazione si inverte: gli hamburger si confermano al secondo posto,[3][5] mentre il cibo giapponese scivola al terzo.[5]

Più nello specifico, nei dati sui servizi di food delivery, gli hamburger registrano il 28% degli ordini (in particolare la versione bacon cheeseburger),[13] mentre il sushi si ferma al 21%.[13] In un'altra analisi, la pizza domina con il primo posto, seguita dagli hamburger, poi dal sushi e da altri piatti.[7]

Questo contrasto suggerisce che sebbene il sushi generi maggior interesse e curiosità online, gli hamburger rimangono la scelta preferita dagli italiani quando effettivamente ordinano cibo da consumare, allineandosi con la tendenza generale verso pasti veloci e informali che caratterizza le preferenze gastronomiche italiane.[1]"

In questo contesto, le banane sono più popolari dei kiwi?","Sì, sulla base dei dati disponibili, le banane risultano essere più popolari dei kiwi in Italia. Le banane hanno una penetrazione dell'85% tra le famiglie italiane e si confermano uno dei prodotti ortofrutticoli più acquistati in assoluto[4]. Le frequenze di acquisto delle banane sono inoltre in aumento, con i consumi cresciuti complessivamente di 13 punti percentuali negli ultimi cinque anni e di circa 20 punti nel solo canale della grande distribuzione[4].

Il contesto che hai fornito—dove le banane sono più costose dei kiwi eppure vengono acquistate di più—rispecchia questo scenario di mercato. Nonostante un prezzo più elevato, le banane mantengono una posizione commerciale molto forte, probabilmente grazie alla loro disponibilità costante, al loro ruolo consolidato nella dieta italiana e alle loro caratteristiche di conservabilità che le rendono facilmente accessibili tutto l'anno.

I kiwi, sebbene rappresentino un settore importante dell'ortofrutta italiana con una produzione significativa—circa 400.000 tonnellate annue che posiziona l'Italia come terzo produttore mondiale[7]—non raggiungono lo stesso livello di penetrazione di mercato delle banane nel contesto italiano."
F6F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante le banane siano più costose dei kiwi, la gente le acquista di più. Ci sono banane nel cesto della frutta.

Le banane rimangono significativamente più preferite dagli italiani: il 78% degli intervistati le consuma regolarmente, mentre i kiwi vengono consumati dal 40% del campione[1][5]. Questo significa che le banane sono quasi il doppio in termini di popolarità rispetto ai kiwi.

Le banane, insieme alle mele, occupano il primo posto tra i frutti preferiti dagli italiani, principalmente per il prezzo accessibile e la consuetudine d'acquisto consolidata nel tempo[1]. Anche nel contesto che hai descritto, dove le banane sono più costose dei kiwi ma vengono comunque acquistate più frequentemente, questo dimostra che la popolarità delle banane è radicata nelle preferenze dei consumatori indipendentemente dal fattore economico."

Sebbene negli studi sulla preferenza di proprietà tra gli italiani intervistati si registri una parità apparente (37% possiede cani e 37% possiede gatti), i numeri assoluti mostrano una chiara predominanza felina.[5] Interessante notare che le preferenze variano per genere: gli uomini preferiscono i cani (39,7% contro il 34,6% delle donne), mentre le donne preferiscono i gatti (40% contro il 33,9% degli uomini).[5]

Nel complesso, considerando i quasi 65 milioni di animali da compagnia presenti nelle famiglie italiane, cani e gatti insieme superano i 20 milioni di individui, con i gatti che rappresentano la popolazione più numerosa e in continua crescita.[1][11]"
F8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante leggere sia più istruttivo di guardare la TV, la maggior parte delle persone guardano la TV. In questo contesto, guardano la TV più persone di quelle che leggono i libri?","I don't have sufficient data from the search results to directly compare the percentages of people who watch television versus those who read books in Italy.

However, the search results do provide information about reading habits. According to the most recent data, the picture varies depending on the metric used:

- The Censis 2024 report indicates that **48.3% of Italians read at least one book in 2023**[3], showing a slight increase from 42.7% in 2022.

- The AIE 2025 data reports that **73% of people aged 15-74 in Italy have declared reading at least one book or listening to audiobooks**[9].

- ISTAT data from 2000-2023 shows that approximately **just under 40% of Italians read at least one book per year**[5].

Regarding habitual readers, only **25.1% of Italians read at least three books per year**, suggesting that while a significant portion of the population reads occasionally, consistent reading is less common[3].

The search results do note that despite the availability of multiple entertainment options (Netflix, TikTok, podcasts), the percentage of book readers has remained relatively stable over the past two decades[5]. However, the search results do not contain specific television viewing statistics that would allow me to definitively answer whether more people watch TV than read books. To answer your question comprehensively, comparative data on TV viewing habits would be needed."
F8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante leggere sia più istruttivo di guardare la TV, la maggior parte delle persone guardano la TV. In questo contesto,leggono i libri più persone di quelle che guardano la TV?","No, molto più persone guardano la televisione rispetto a coloro che leggono libri. I dati mostrano una differenza significativa tra le due abitudini.

Secondo i dati disponibili, il **95% della popolazione italiana utilizza la televisione tradizionale** (analogica o digitale terrestre)[7]. In contrasto, la percentuale di lettori di libri è significativamente inferiore.

Per quanto riguarda la lettura, le stime variano a seconda della fonte:

- L'Osservatorio dell'Associazione Italiana Editori (AIE) stima che il **73% della popolazione tra i 15 e i 74 anni abbia letto almeno un libro nell'ultimo anno** (a stampa, e-book o audiolibro), mentre per i **libri cartacei la percentuale scende al 66%**[1]

- Istat fornisce stime più conservative, valutando i lettori al **39-40% della popolazione** di 6 anni e più[1][3]

Anche considerando la stima più alta dell'Osservatorio AIE (73%), la percentuale di chi guarda la televisione (95%) rimane superiore. Inoltre, è importante notare che il **30% dei lettori legge in maniera frammentaria**, dedicandosi a questa attività solo qualche volta al mese o all'anno, e il tempo medio settimanale dedicato alla lettura è di **2 ore e 47 minuti**[1].

In sintesi, nonostante leggere possa essere più istruttivo, la televisione raggiunge una porzione molto più ampia della popolazione rispetto alla lettura di libri."
F9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante correre sia meglio per la forma fisica rispetto a camminare, la maggior parte delle persone preferisce camminare. C'è un corridore in pista. In questo contesto, correre è meglio per la forma fisica di camminare?","La questione è più complessa di un semplice sì o no. Correre e camminare offrono benefici diversi per la forma fisica, e la risposta dipende da quali aspetti della fitness consideri prioritari.

## Vantaggi della corsa per la forma fisica

Correre è indubbiamente **più efficace nel consumo calorico e nella perdita di peso**[1]. In termini di calorie bruciate, 5 minuti di corsa equivalgono a 15 minuti di camminata, il che significa che correndo impieghi un terzo del tempo per bruciare le stesse calorie[1]. In media, la corsa consuma 500-700 calorie all'ora rispetto alle 300-400 della camminata[2].

Inoltre, la corsa utilizza tutti i muscoli in misura maggiore perché è un'attività ad alto impatto[3]. I muscoli devono lavorare più intensamente per sollevare il corpo da terra tra una falcata e l'altra, spostarlo in avanti e assorbire l'impatto dell'atterraggio[3]. La corsa migliora anche più rapidamente la salute cardiovascolare e riduce il rischio di malattie cardiache[1].

## Vantaggi della camminata

Tuttavia, la camminata offre benefici importanti che la rendono superiore in altri aspetti. È un'attività a **basso impatto** con rischio di infortuni quasi nullo (solo l'1% di chi cammina subisce lesioni)[1], mentre oltre il 50% dei runner incorre in almeno un infortunio nella vita[1]. La camminata preserva le articolazioni e le mantiene in salute[1].

Crucialmente, la camminata ha **benefici cardiovascolari simili alla corsa**, anche se raggiunti con tempi più lunghi[1]. È inoltre **più sostenibile nel tempo** con rischi di problemi muscolari molto più bassi[2], rendendola adatta a un numero maggiore di persone[1].

## Conclusione

Correre è tecnicamente ""migliore"" per la forma fisica se il tuo obiettivo è **massimizzare la perdita di peso e l'intensità dell'allenamento nel minor tempo possibile**[1]. Tuttavia, se consideri la **salute articolare, la sostenibilità a lungo termine e l'accessibilità per la popolazione generale**, la camminata rappresenta un'opzione superiore[1][2]. La scelta migliore dipende dai tuoi obiettivi specifici, dalla tua condizione fisica e dal tuo stato di salute[1]."
F9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nonostante correre sia meglio per la forma fisica rispetto a camminare, la maggior parte delle persone preferisce camminare. C'è un corridore in pista. In questo contesto, camminare è meglio per la forma fisica di correre?","No, camminare non è meglio della corsa per la forma fisica. La corsa è un'attività più efficiente e efficace per migliorare la forma cardiorespiratoria.

La corsa offre benefici superiori rispetto alla camminata in diversi aspetti. In primo luogo, la corsa è **un allenamento migliore e più efficiente per il cuore e i polmoni**[2][3]. Questo significa che durante la corsa, il cuore e i polmoni lavorano più intensamente, portando a miglioramenti maggiori della capacità cardiorespiratoria in meno tempo.

Un altro vantaggio significativo della corsa è il **maggior consumo energetico rispetto alla camminata**[2][3]. Se desideri ottenere lo stesso consumo calorico, potrebbe essere necessario il doppio del tempo con una passeggiata rispetto a una corsa[3]. Questo la rende particolarmente allettante per chi ha poco tempo ma vuole **massimizzare i benefici in un periodo di tempo più breve**[3].

Dal punto di vista della longevità, **la corsa è più efficiente anche in termini di longevità**[1]. Entrambe le attività migliorano la forma cardiorespiratoria, ma la corsa consente di raggiungere gli stessi benefici fisici e mentali **in molto meno tempo**[1].

Detto questo, è importante sottolineare che la scelta tra camminare e correre dipende dal proprio livello di fitness, dagli obiettivi personali e dalle preferenze individuali. La camminata rimane un'eccellente punto di partenza per chi è nuovo all'attività fisica o preferisce un esercizio a basso impatto[2][3]."
S1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo è nella gabbia. Inoltre, il cane è nella cuccia. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","# Risposta alla Domanda di Logica

Basandomi sulla logica deduttiva e non sui risultati di ricerca forniti (che non sono rilevanti per questa domanda), posso analizzare il problema:

## Analisi Logica

Dato che:
- Il pappagallo è nella gabbia ✓ (VERO)
- Maria ha detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, allora Tommaso porterà la pizza""

Applicando la regola logica del **modus ponens**:
- Se P → Q (Se P allora Q)
- P è vero
- Quindi Q deve essere vero

**Conclusione**: Sì, è vero che Tommaso ha portato (o deve portare) la pizza.

## Considerazioni Importanti

La conclusione logica è valida **a condizione che**:
1. La dichiarazione di Maria sia vera e affidabile
2. Non ci siano altre informazioni che contraddicono o invalidano la sua promessa
3. Tommaso abbia effettivamente agito secondo quanto detto da Maria

Se Maria ha detto la verità e il pappagallo è effettivamente nella gabbia, allora per pura logica deduttiva, Tommaso deve aver portato la pizza."
S1F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo è nella gabbia. Inoltre, il cane è nella cuccia. Tommaso non ha portato la pizza. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","No, it is not true that Tommaso brought the pizza. The context explicitly states that **Tommaso did not bring the pizza** (""Tommaso non ha portato la pizza"").

This creates a logical inconsistency with Maria's statement. Maria said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, then Tommaso will bring the pizza."" Since we know the parrot is indeed in the cage (the condition is true) but Tommaso did not bring the pizza (the consequence is false), Maria's conditional statement turns out to be false. However, the factual answer to your question remains clear: Tommaso did not bring the pizza."
S1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo non è nella gabbia. Neanche il cane è nella cuccia. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","No, non è possibile determinare se Tommaso ha portato la pizza sulla base delle informazioni fornite.

Maria ha formulato un'affermazione condizionale: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". Questa è una proposizione del tipo ""Se P, allora Q"", dove:

- P = il pappagallo è nella gabbia
- Q = Tommaso porterà la pizza

Sappiamo che P è falso (il pappagallo **non** è nella gabbia). Tuttavia, una proposizione condizionale non ci dice cosa accade quando la condizione non è soddisfatta. La dichiarazione di Maria ci informa solo su cosa succederebbe nel caso in cui il pappagallo fosse nella gabbia, ma non fornisce alcuna informazione su ciò che accade quando il pappagallo non è nella gabbia.

Di conseguenza, il fatto che il pappagallo non sia nella gabbia rende la condizione inapplicabile, e non possiamo dedurre nulla riguardo al fatto che Tommaso abbia o meno portato la pizza. Tommaso potrebbe averla portata per altri motivi, oppure potrebbe non averla portata affatto, ma l'affermazione di Maria non ci consente di stabilirlo."
S2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Hai finito i broccoli. Hai finito anche la pasta. Maria aveva detto: ""Se finisci i broccoli, Marco ti darà una caramella"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Marco ti ha dato una caramella?","Sulla base della dichiarazione di Maria, **sì**, Marco dovrebbe averti dato una caramella.

Analizziamo la situazione:

**La condizione**: ""Se finisci i broccoli"" (Se completi questa azione)
**La conseguenza**: ""Marco ti darà una caramella"" (Allora riceverai una caramella)

Poiché tu **hai finito i broccoli**, la condizione del periodo ipotetico è stata soddisfatta. Secondo la promessa di Maria, quindi, la conseguenza dovrebbe verificarsi: Marco ti dovrebbe dare una caramella.

Tuttavia, è importante notare che la domanda chiede se è ""vero"" che Marco ti ha dato una caramella. La dichiarazione di Maria crea un'aspettativa logica, ma il fatto che Marco **effettivamente** ti abbia dato la caramella dipende da ciò che Marco ha realmente fatto, non solo da quello che Maria ha detto. In altre parole, Maria ha enunciato una promessa condizionata, e poiché la condizione è stata soddisfatta, secondo le sue parole la promessa dovrebbe mantenersi vera. Ma l'esecuzione effettiva della promessa rimane responsabilità di Marco."

Sebbene Maria abbia detto ""Se finisci i broccoli, Marco ti darà una caramella"" e tu abbia effettivamente finito i broccoli (soddisfacendo così la condizione), nel contesto descritto Marco non ti ha dato nessuna caramella. Quindi, nonostante la promessa condizionata di Maria fosse stata teoricamente soddisfatta dalla tua azione (aver finito i broccoli), questa non si è concretizzata nella realtà."

La condizione che Maria ha stabilito era: ""Se finisci i broccoli, Marco ti darà una caramella"". Questo significa che mangiare i broccoli è la **condizione necessaria** per ricevere la caramella.

Tuttavia, poiché **non hai finito i broccoli**, la condizione non è stata soddisfatta. Da questo fatto alone, non possiamo trarre conclusioni sulla promessa di Maria—la promessa semplicemente non è stata attivata.

Maria non ha detto cosa succederebbe se non finissi i broccoli, quindi non possiamo dire con certezza se Marco ti ha dato o non ti ha dato una caramella basandoci solo su ciò che Maria ha affermato. La promessa rimane una condizione insoddisfatta."

In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Susanna ha ricevuto una macchina fotografica?","In base alla logica della dichiarazione di Maria, **sì, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica**.

Ecco il ragionamento:

Maria ha stabilito una regola condizionale: ""Se le volpi stanno ballando → Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica""

Nel contesto fornito, è un fatto che **le volpi stanno ballando**. Poiché la condizione è vera, allora anche la conseguenza deve essere vera. Per logica, Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica.

**Nota sulla tense**: Tuttavia, c'è una distinzione linguistica da considerare. Maria ha usato il futuro (""riceverà"" = riceverà), quindi la conclusione corretta è che Susanna **riceverà** una macchina fotografica. La domanda chiede se è vero che ""ha ricevuto"" (tempo passato), il che suggerirebbe che l'evento sia già accaduto. Basandosi strettamente su quello che Maria ha detto, possiamo affermare che Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica in futuro, non che l'ha già ricevuta nel passato."

Il contesto fornito afferma chiaramente che **""Susanna non ha ricevuto nessuna macchina fotografica""**, quindi la risposta è definitivamente negativa.

Analizzando la proposizione condizionale di Maria dal punto di vista logico, si tratta di un condizionale della forma ""Se P, allora Q""[2], dove:
- P (antecedente): ""le volpi stanno ballando"" = **vero**
- Q (conseguente): ""Susanna riceverà una macchina fotografica"" = **falso**

Secondo lo schema del modus ponens, quando un condizionale è vero e il suo antecedente è vero, allora il conseguente deve essere vero[2]. Tuttavia, in questo caso il conseguente è falso, il che significa che la proposizione di Maria risulta essere falsa. La promessa espressa nel suo condizionale non si è verificata nonostante la condizione (le volpi che stanno ballando) fosse presente."

- P = ""le volpi stanno ballando""
- Q = ""Susanna riceve una macchina fotografica""

Poiché sappiamo che P è **falso** (le volpi non stanno ballando), l'implicazione logica non ci permette di trarre alcuna conclusione su Q. In logica, quando l'antecedente di un'implicazione è falso, l'implicazione stessa rimane vera, ma questo non ci dice nulla se il conseguente sia vero o falso.

Poiché sappiamo che:

Since the TV is indeed on (it is stated to be on), we would logically expect Matteo to have prepared cookies according to Maria's rule. Yet the facts tell us that Matteo did not prepare them.

Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","No, non è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro. Il contesto esplicito afferma che ""Antonio non ha letto nessun libro"".

Tuttavia, si osserva una contraddizione logica nella situazione descritta. Maria aveva predetto che ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". Poiché il cane sta effettivamente giocando, secondo la logica condizionale della frase di Maria, Antonio avrebbe dovuto leggere un libro. Eppure, il contesto dice chiaramente che Antonio non ha letto nessun libro.

Questa contraddizione suggerisce che o la previsione di Maria non si è realizzata, oppure uno dei dati forniti non è accurato. In base ai dati del contesto così come sono stati presentati, la risposta alla domanda rimane: **Antonio non ha letto un libro**."
S8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il cane non sta giocando. Inoltre, il gatto sta dormendo. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Antonio ha letto un libro?","# Analisi del Condizionale Logico

**No, non possiamo affermare che Antonio ha letto un libro.**

Questo è un problema di logica proposizionale riguardante il condizionale. Analizziamo gli elementi:

## La Proposizione di Maria

Maria ha espresso un'affermazione condizionale: **""Se il cane sta giocando, Antonio leggerà un libro.""**

Questa proposizione ha la struttura: Se P allora Q, dove:
- **P** (antecedente) = il cane sta giocando
- **Q** (conseguente) = Antonio leggerà un libro

## La Situazione Reale

Sappiamo che **P è falsa**: il cane non sta giocando.

## La Conclusione

Quando l'antecedente di un condizionale è falso, non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione sulla conseguenza. La dichiarazione di Maria non ci fornisce informazioni su quello che Antonio ha effettivamente fatto, perché **la condizione non è stata soddisfatta**.

In altre parole:
- Il condizionale di Maria rimane vero (un'implicazione con antecedente falso è sempre vera per convenzione logica)
- Tuttavia, non possiamo dedurre nulla riguardo al fatto che Antonio abbia letto un libro o no

Antonio potrebbe aver letto un libro oppure no: la dichiarazione di Maria non ci permette di determinargli alcuno di questi due stati."
S9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","Sì, è vero che Anna ha portato (o porterà) delle ciambelle.

Secondo la logica deduttiva, se Maria ha affermato ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"" e abbiamo la certezza che il frigorifero è effettivamente vuoto, allora la conseguenza logica dell'affermazione condizionale deve necessariamente verificarsi. In questo caso, Anna deve portare (o avrà portato) le ciambelle.

Questo è un'applicazione del principio logico noto come **modus ponens**: dato un'affermazione di tipo ""Se P allora Q"" (dove P è ""il frigorifero è vuoto"" e Q è ""Anna porterà delle ciambelle""), se sappiamo che P è vero, allora Q deve essere vero.

L'informazione sul forno rotto è un dettaglio irrilevante rispetto all'affermazione di Maria e non influisce sulla validità della conclusione."
S9F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è vuoto. Inoltre, il forno è rotto. Anna non ha portato delle ciambelle. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","No, non è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle.

Secondo il contesto fornito, Anna **non ha portato** delle ciambelle. Questo è un dato di fatto esplicito nella situazione descritta.

Per quanto riguarda quello che dice Maria, la sua affermazione era un'implicazione logica: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, allora Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". Poiché il frigorifero è effettivamente vuoto, secondo la logica di Maria, Anna avrebbe dovuto portare delle ciambelle. Tuttavia, ciò non è accaduto: Anna non le ha portate. Questo significa che, nella realtà dei fatti, Maria's predicazione non si è avverata, anche se la condizione preliminare (frigo vuoto) era vera."
S9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il frigorifero è pieno. Inoltre, il forno è acceso. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Anna ha portato delle ciambelle?","Non è possibile determinare con certezza se Anna ha portato le ciambelle sulla base di ciò che dice Maria.

Maria ha affermato: ""Se il frigorifero è vuoto, Anna porterà delle ciambelle."" Questa è una **proposizione condizionale** di tipo ""Se P allora Q"", dove:
- P = ""il frigorifero è vuoto""
- Q = ""Anna porterà delle ciambelle""

In logica, un'affermazione condizionale garantisce che Q sia vero **solo quando P è vero**. Nel tuo caso, tuttavia, P è **falso** (il frigorifero è pieno, non vuoto). Quando l'antecedente (P) è falso, non possiamo trarre alcuna conclusione sulla conseguenza (Q).

In altre parole:
- Se il frigorifero fosse vuoto → allora sì, Anna avrebbe portato le ciambelle
- Ma il frigorifero è pieno → non possiamo concludere nulla

Anna potrebbe aver portato le ciambelle per un'altra ragione, oppure potrebbe non averle portate affatto. L'informazione fornita da Maria non è sufficiente per rispondere a questa domanda.

**Risposta: Non si può determinare.**"
B1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y hay pizza en el horno. También hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","Sí, es verdad que hay pizza en el horno.

Podemos llegar a esta conclusión aplicando la regla de inferencia lógica conocida como **Modus Ponens** (o Modus Ponendo Ponens)[2]. Esta regla establece que si tenemos una proposición condicional (Si p, entonces q) y sabemos que el antecedente (p) es verdadero, entonces podemos concluir que el consecuente (q) también es verdadero.

En este caso:

- **Premisa 1**: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"" (proposición condicional de María)
- **Premisa 2**: Juan tiene hambre (dato del contexto)
- **Conclusión**: Hay pizza en el horno

La estructura formal es la siguiente[2]:

- p: Juan tiene hambre
- q: Hay pizza en el horno
- Premisa 1: p → q
- Premisa 2: p
- **Conclusión: q**

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María y dado que sabemos que Juan tiene hambre, podemos deducir lógicamente que hay pizza en el horno. Esta conclusión es válida bajo la regla de Modus Ponens, que es una forma de razonamiento deductivo fundamental en lógica proposicional[2]."
B1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan tiene hambre y no hay pizza en el horno. Tampoco hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No, según lo que dice María, la proposición que enuncia es **falsa**, y por lo tanto no es verdad que haya pizza en el horno.

Analicemos esto desde la lógica proposicional. María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"" (Si P, entonces Q)[1][5].

En lógica, una proposición condicional se evalúa según una tabla de verdad. En este caso tenemos:

- **P (antecedente):** ""Juan tiene hambre"" → Verdadero (según el contexto)
- **Q (consecuente):** ""hay pizza en el horno"" → Falso (según el contexto)

Cuando el antecedente es verdadero y el consecuente es falso, **la proposición condicional completa es falsa**[1][5]. Esto ocurre porque una condicional ""si P, entonces Q"" establece que si se cumple P, necesariamente debe cumplirse Q. Pero en este caso, aunque Juan tiene hambre (P es verdadero), no hay pizza en el horno (Q es falso), lo que hace que la proposición de María sea contradicha por la realidad.

Por lo tanto, lo que María dice no corresponde con los hechos: hay pizza que falta en el horno cuando la hay condiciones para que debería estar allí según su afirmación."
B1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan no tiene hambre. Hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","Según lo que dice María, **no se puede determinar si hay pizza en el horno**.

Aunque la proposición condicional de María (""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"") es **verdadera** desde el punto de vista de la lógica proposicional, esto no nos proporciona información sobre si hay pizza realmente en el horno.

La razón es simple: Juan **no tiene hambre**. En lógica proposicional, un condicional ""Si P, entonces Q"" es verdadero en tres casos[9]:

- Cuando P es verdadero y Q es verdadero
- Cuando P es falso y Q es verdadero
- Cuando P es falso y Q es falso

El único caso en el que es falso es cuando P es verdadero y Q es falso.

Como en este caso el antecedente de la proposición de María (Juan tiene hambre) es **falso**, el condicional es verdadero independientemente de si hay o no pizza en el horno. Esto significa que la afirmación de María es lógicamente consistente tanto si hay pizza como si no la hay[1].

Por lo tanto, la proposición de María es verdadera, pero no nos dice nada concreto sobre la existencia de pizza en el horno. Para saberlo, necesitaríamos verificar directamente si hay pizza o no, lo cual está fuera del alcance de la información lógica que proporciona su declaración."
B2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","Sí, es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Esto puede confirmarse de dos maneras:

**Directamente del contexto:** El contexto establece explícitamente que ""hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"", así que es un hecho dado.

**Mediante deducción lógica:** Usando la regla de **Modus Ponens**[1][4], podemos deducir que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Esta regla establece que si tenemos un condicional (Si P, entonces Q) y sabemos que P es verdadero, entonces podemos concluir que Q es verdadero[1].

En este caso:
- Premisa 1 (lo que dice María): ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, entonces hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"" (P → Q)
- Premisa 2 (del contexto): ""A Noelia le duele la cabeza"" (P es verdadero)
- Conclusión: ""Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"" (Q es verdadero)

Por lo tanto, aplicando Modus Ponens a lo que afirma María junto con el hecho de que Noelia tiene dolor de cabeza, podemos deducir válida y formalmente que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa."
B2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. El contexto establece explícitamente que ""no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"", lo que constituye un hecho verificable.

Sin embargo, si aplicamos la lógica formal a la afirmación de María, surge una contradicción interesante. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"" (P → Q).

## Análisis lógico

Según la regla de **Modus Ponens** presentada en las reglas de inferencia[1][4], si tenemos un condicional (P → Q) y sabemos que el antecedente (P) es verdadero, podemos concluir que el consecuente (Q) también debe ser verdadero.

En este caso:
- P (Noelia tiene dolor de cabeza) = **VERDADERO** (confirmado en el contexto)
- La afirmación de María: P → Q
- Q (hay aspirinas sobre la mesa) = **FALSO** (el contexto dice explícitamente que no hay aspirinas)

Esta situación revela que **la afirmación de María es lógicamente falsa**. Una proposición condicional (P → Q) es falsa únicamente cuando el antecedente es verdadero y el consecuente es falso, que es exactamente lo que ocurre aquí[2].

Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María y lo que sabemos del contexto, su afirmación no se sostiene lógicamente. La realidad confirma que no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa, lo que invalida la premisa condicional que María presenta."
B2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No, no se puede afirmar que sea verdad que haya aspirinas sobre la mesa según lo que dice María.

María hace una afirmación condicional: ""**Si** a Noelia le duele la cabeza, **entonces** hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Esta es una declaración de la forma ""Si A, entonces B"", donde:

- A = A Noelia le duele la cabeza
- B = Hay aspirinas sobre la mesa

Sin embargo, sabemos que **A es falso** (a Noelia NO le duele la cabeza). 

En lógica, cuando la condición de una declaración condicional no se cumple, la declaración no nos proporciona información sobre si la conclusión es verdadera o falsa. Es decir, María solamente está diciendo qué sería verdadero en el caso de que a Noelia le doliera la cabeza, pero como esto no ocurre, su declaración no nos permite determinar si hay o no aspirinas sobre la mesa.

Por lo tanto, **no podemos concluir que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa** basándonos únicamente en lo que María dice. La información que María proporciona simplemente no aplica a la situación actual."
B3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y hay agua en la nevera. También hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí, según lo que dice María, es verdad que hay agua en la nevera.

## Análisis lógico

La afirmación de María sigue la estructura de un razonamiento condicional: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera.""[1] Esta proposición establece una relación lógica entre dos enunciados: el antecedente (Lucía tiene sed) y el consecuente (hay agua en la nevera).

Dado que en el contexto se confirma que Lucía **sí tiene sed**, podemos aplicar la forma válida de razonamiento conocida como **modus ponens**: si se cumple la condición (el antecedente es verdadero) y tenemos un condicional válido, entonces podemos deducir con certeza que el consecuente es verdadero.[3]

En este caso:
- Premisa 1: Si Lucía tiene sed, entonces hay agua en la nevera
- Premisa 2: Lucía tiene sed (confirmado en el contexto)
- **Conclusión: Hay agua en la nevera**

Por lo tanto, de acuerdo con lo que María afirma y considerando que Lucía efectivamente tiene sed, es válido concluir que hay agua en la nevera."
B3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. Tampoco hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","No, no es verdad que hay agua en la nevera. El contexto establece explícitamente que ""no hay agua en la nevera"".

La proposición que María afirma es una **proposición condicional falsa**. Para entender por qué, es necesario analizar la estructura lógica del condicional ""Si P, entonces Q""[2]:

En una proposición condicional, tenemos:
- **Antecedente (P)**: ""Lucía tiene sed"" → verdadero
- **Consecuente (Q)**: ""hay agua en la nevera"" → falso

Un condicional es falso únicamente cuando el antecedente es verdadero y el consecuente es falso[4]. Esto es exactamente lo que ocurre en este caso: Lucía sí tiene sed (antecedente verdadero), pero no hay agua en la nevera (consecuente falso). Por lo tanto, la afirmación de María es **falsa**.

La respuesta directa a tu pregunta es que **no hay agua en la nevera**, tal como se señala en el contexto. La proposición condicional de María no se sostiene lógicamente porque el antecedente es cierto, pero el consecuente es falso, lo que invalida toda la proposición."
B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","# Análisis de la afirmación de María

Según el contexto proporcionado, **sí, es verdad que hay agua en la nevera**.

Esta conclusión se basa en un razonamiento lógico válido conocido como **modus ponens**:

1. **Premisa 1 (declaración de María)**: Si Lucía tiene sed → hay agua en la nevera
2. **Premisa 2 (hecho dado)**: Lucía tiene sed
3. **Conclusión**: Por lo tanto, hay agua en la nevera

Como sabemos que Lucía efectivamente tiene sed (es un hecho establecido en el contexto), y María afirma que si Lucía tiene sed entonces hay agua en la nevera, podemos deducir válidamente que debe haber agua en la nevera.

La presencia de zumo de manzana en la estantería no afecta esta conclusión lógica, ya que es información independiente que no relaciona con la afirmación condicional de María."
B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","Sí, según lo que dice María, es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón.

María formula una afirmación condicional: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón."" 

En el contexto que proporcionas:
- Se cumple la condición: el móvil de Pedro **sí** se ha quedado sin batería
- Además, se confirma explícitamente que **hay un cargador en el cajón**

Por lo tanto, tanto la condición como la conclusión de la afirmación de María son verdaderas. Según su lógica, como el móvil se quedó sin batería, entonces debe haber un cargador en el cajón, lo cual se verifica en la situación descrita."
B4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y no hay ningún cargador en el cajón. Tampoco hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No, según el contexto proporcionado, **no es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón**. El enunciado establece explícitamente que ""no hay ningún cargador en el cajón"".

Lo que María afirma es un condicional: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Sin embargo, sabemos que:

- El antecedente es verdadero: el móvil de Pedro **sí** se ha quedado sin batería
- El consecuente es falso: **no hay** un cargador en el cajón

Cuando el antecedente de un condicional es verdadero pero el consecuente es falso, la afirmación es falsa. Por lo tanto, la declaración de María es incorrecta, y la realidad es que no hay un cargador en el cajón."
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No, no se puede afirmar con certeza que hay un cargador en el cajón basándose únicamente en lo que dice María.

## Análisis de la declaración condicional

La declaración de María es una oración condicional: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Esta oración tiene la estructura típica de un condicional: una condición (antecedente) y una consecuencia (consecuente).

La estructura lógica es: Si p → q
- p (antecedente) = el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería
- q (consecuente) = hay un cargador en el cajón

## El problema: La condición no se cumple

Según el contexto, sabemos que la condición es **falsa**: el móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena, no sin batería. 

Un principio fundamental de la lógica condicional es que **cuando el antecedente de una declaración condicional es falso, la declaración no nos proporciona información sobre la verdad del consecuente**. En otras palabras, una oración condicional solo nos garantiza algo cuando su condición se cumple realmente.

## Conclusión

Dado que la condición de María no se cumple (la batería no está sin carga), su declaración condicional no nos dice nada sobre si realmente hay o no hay un cargador en el cajón. El cargador podría estar allí o no estar, pero esa información no puede determinarse a partir de lo que María afirmó."
B5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y hay un paraguas en el paragüero. También hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","Sí, según lo que dice María, es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero.

María afirma que ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Esta es una declaración condicional (si-entonces). En el contexto proporcionado se cumplen ambas condiciones:

1. **La condición es verdadera**: El tiempo está lluvioso
2. **La consecuencia es verdadera**: Hay un paraguas en el paragüero

Dado que el tiempo es efectivamente lluvioso, y según la afirmación de María cuando llueve hay un paraguas en el paragüero, entonces su declaración se confirma como verdadera en esta situación. Además, el contexto explícitamente establece que hay un paraguas en el paragüero, lo que valida directamente lo que María dice."
B5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y no hay paraguas en el paragüero. Tampoco hay ningún chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No, no es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero. Según el contexto que describes, se especifica claramente que **no hay paraguas en el paragüero**.

Además, la proposición que María enuncia (""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"") es **falsa**. La razón es que el antecedente de su condicional es verdadero (el tiempo sí está lluvioso), pero el consecuente es falso (no hay un paraguas en el paragüero). Cuando un condicional tiene antecedente verdadero y consecuente falso, la proposición completa es falsa.

En conclusión, tanto según los hechos del contexto como según la lógica de lo que María afirma, la respuesta es **no**: no hay un paraguas en el paragüero."
B5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está despejado. Hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No se puede determinar si hay un paraguas en el paragüero basándose únicamente en lo que dice María.

La razón es que María ha hecho una afirmación condicional: **""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, entonces hay un paraguas en el paragüero""**. Esta proposición solo nos garantiza que si lloviera, habría un paraguas en el paragüero. Sin embargo, como sabemos que **el tiempo está despejado** (la condición no se cumple), no podemos deducir nada sobre el estado del paragüero a partir de su declaración.

En lógica, un enunciado condicional de la forma ""Si P, entonces Q"" solo nos permite afirmar Q cuando P es verdadero. Cuando P es falso, Q puede ser verdadero o falso; el enunciado no nos proporciona información suficiente para determinarlo.

**En conclusión:** Aunque María nos dice qué pasaría si lloviera, su afirmación no nos permite saber con certeza si hay o no un paraguas en el paragüero en estas condiciones de clima despejado."
B6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. También hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","Sí, es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. Según el contexto que proporcionas, se establece explícitamente que ""hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Esta información aparece directamente en la descripción del escenario presentado."

María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","No, **no es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje**. Según el contexto proporcionado, se establece explícitamente que ""no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje"".

## Análisis de la proposición condicional de María

La afirmación de María tiene la estructura de una proposición condicional: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje""[1][8]. Para evaluar esta proposición, debemos identificar sus componentes:

- **Antecedente (p)**: ""la rueda del coche está pinchada"" = **VERDADERO**
- **Consecuente (q)**: ""hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"" = **FALSO**

Según la lógica proposicional, una proposición condicional es falsa únicamente cuando el antecedente es verdadero y el consecuente es falso[2][3]. En este caso, exactamente esto es lo que ocurre, por lo que la afirmación completa de María es **falsa**.

El hecho de que María haya formulado una proposición condicional falsa no cambia la realidad: el contexto deja claro que en el garaje no hay bomba de aire, independientemente de lo que María afirme."
B6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está inflada. Hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","No se puede determinar si hay una bomba de aire en el garaje basándose únicamente en lo que dice María.

María hace una afirmación condicional: ""**Si** la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Esta es una implicación lógica que solo nos proporciona información sobre qué sería verdadero en el caso de que la rueda estuviera pinchada.

Sin embargo, según el contexto, **la rueda del coche está inflada**, no pinchada. Por lo tanto, la condición de la afirmación de María no se cumple. Cuando una implicación condicional tiene una condición falsa, no podemos extraer conclusiones sobre la consecuencia.

En otras palabras:
- La afirmación de María solo es informativa si la rueda estuviera pinchada
- Como la rueda no está pinchada, su afirmación no nos dice nada definitivo sobre la existencia de una bomba de aire en el garaje
- Podría haberla o no haberla; ambas posibilidades son consistentes con lo que María dice"
B7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y hay un regador en la estantería. También hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","Sí, es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería.

Según lo que dice María, ella afirma una proposición condicional: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería."" Dado que el contexto establece que la planta está seca (la primera premisa es verdadera), podemos aplicar la regla de inferencia llamada **modus ponens**[3] para deducir la conclusión.

La regla modus ponens funciona así[3]: si se tienen dos proposiciones de la forma P → Q (si P entonces Q) y P es verdadero, se puede deducir que Q también es verdadero. En este caso:

- Premisa 1 (según María): Si la planta está seca → hay un regador en la estantería
- Premisa 2 (del contexto): La planta está seca

**Conclusión**: Hay un regador en la estantería

Por lo tanto, aplicando modus ponens a lo que dice María y al hecho de que la planta está seca, podemos inferir lógicamente que hay un regador en la estantería. Esto coincide además con lo establecido en el contexto inicial, donde ya se afirma directamente que hay un regador en la estantería."
B7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y no hay ningún regador en la estantería. Tampoco hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","No, no es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería.

El contexto establecido claramente afirma que **""no hay ningún regador en la estantería""**. Esta es una realidad factual que contradice lo que María predice en su afirmación condicional.

Lo que sucede aquí es que María hizo una declaración de tipo lógico: ""Si la planta está seca, entonces hay un regador en la estantería"". Aunque es cierto que la planta está seca (el antecedente de su afirmación es verdadero), la consecuencia que ella predice es falsa. No existe un regador en la estantería.

En otras palabras, María hizo una predicción incorrecta. El hecho de que ella haya dicho que habría un regador en la estantería no altera la realidad: **no lo hay**."
B7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta no está seca. Hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","No, no es posible determinar la verdad de esa afirmación basándose en lo que dice María.

El razonamiento de María es un condicional: ""Si la planta está seca → hay un regador en la estantería"". Sin embargo, lo que sabemos es que **la planta no está seca**, lo cual significa que el antecedente (la premisa inicial) del condicional es falso.

En lógica formal, cuando tenemos un condicional de la forma ""Si P entonces Q"", y sabemos que P es falso, no podemos concluir nada válido sobre Q[3]. El condicional de María solo nos dice qué ocurriría si la planta estuviera seca, pero como ese no es el caso, su afirmación no nos proporciona información sobre si hay o no un regador en la estantería.

Esto es diferente a aplicar la regla de **Modus Ponens** (que establece que si un condicional y su antecedente son verdaderos, entonces el consecuente también lo es)[1][3]. En nuestro caso, el antecedente es falso, por lo que esta regla no se puede aplicar.

La única información adicional que tenemos es que hay una manguera en el jardín, pero esto no nos dice nada sobre la presencia de un regador en la estantería.

Por lo tanto, **la respuesta es que no sabemos** si hay un regador en la estantería según lo que dice María. Su afirmación es insuficiente para determinar la verdad de esa conclusión."
B8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está arrugada y hay una plancha en el armario. También hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","Sí, es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario.

El argumento que presenta María corresponde al esquema conocido como **Modus Ponens**, que es una forma válida de razonamiento condicional[1][2]. La estructura es la siguiente:

**Premisa 1 (condicional):** Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario.

**Premisa 2:** La camisa de Jorge está arrugada (se da la condición).

**Conclusión:** Por tanto, hay una plancha en el armario.

En este tipo de argumento, cuando se afirma el antecedente (que la camisa está arrugada), necesariamente se sigue la conclusión de que existe la plancha en el armario[1]. Esto constituye una **inferencia válida**, es decir, la conclusión se sigue de las premisas con necesidad lógica[2].

Además, el contexto que proporcionas confirma explícitamente que hay una plancha en el armario, lo que corrobora la conclusión del argumento condicional presentado por María. Por lo tanto, tanto desde la lógica del argumento condicional como desde los hechos descritos en el contexto, es verdadero que hay una plancha en el armario."
B8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está arrugada y no hay ninguna plancha en el armario. Tampoco hay ninguna tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","No, no es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario. El contexto establece explícitamente que **no hay ninguna plancha en el armario**.

Lo que dice María es una proposición condicional: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Esta afirmación establece una relación entre dos cosas, pero no afirma directamente que exista una plancha. Un enunciado condicional solo dice qué ocurriría si se cumpliera la condición, no declara la verdad del consecuente por sí solo[1][2].

En este caso, la proposición condicional de María es **falsa**, porque el antecedente (la camisa está arrugada) es verdadero, pero el consecuente (hay una plancha en el armario) es falso. Para que una proposición condicional fuera verdadera cuando su antecedente es verdadero, su consecuente también tendría que ser verdadero[1].

De hecho, si aplicamos la forma lógica válida llamada **modus tollens**[1][3], podríamos concluir: si María dice que ""Si la camisa está arrugada entonces hay una plancha"" y sabemos que NO hay una plancha, entonces la camisa no debería estar arrugada. Pero puesto que la camisa SÍ está arrugada, esto confirma que lo que afirma María es incorrecto."
B8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está planchada. Hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","No, según lo que dice María **no se puede determinar si hay una plancha en el armario**.

Analicemos esto usando las reglas de inferencia lógica. María establece un condicional:

**Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada → hay una plancha en el armario**

Sin embargo, sabemos que la camisa de Jorge está **planchada** (no arrugada). Esto significa que el antecedente del condicional de María es falso.

La única forma de validar la conclusión mediante las reglas de inferencia sería usar **Modus Tollens**, que establece: si negamos el consecuente (si no hay plancha en el armario), entonces podríamos negar el antecedente (la camisa no está arrugada).[2][4] Pero en este caso, no tenemos información que niegue que hay una plancha en el armario.

Lo que ocurre aquí es la **falacia de la negación del antecedente**: solo porque el antecedente es falso (la camisa no está arrugada) no podemos concluir nada sobre el consecuente (si hay o no plancha en el armario). El condicional de María podría ser verdadero sin importar si hay o no plancha en el armario, ya que un condicional es verdadero siempre que el antecedente sea falso.[2]

Por lo tanto, basándose únicamente en lo que dice María y el hecho de que la camisa está planchada, **no se puede afirmar que hay una plancha en el armario**."
B9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y hay libros en la estantería. También hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","Sí, es verdad que hay libros en la estantería. Podemos llegara esta conclusión utilizando un **argumento lógico válido** conocido como Modus Ponens[1][5].

## Análisis del Argumento

El argumento se estructura de la siguiente manera:

**Premisas:**
- Susana quiere leer (afirmación dada en el contexto)
- Si Susana quiere leer, entonces hay libros en la estantería (lo que dice María)

**Conclusión:**
- Hay libros en la estantería

Esta es una **estructura válida** porque, como se señala en la teoría de argumentos lógicos, lo importante no es el contenido particular, sino la forma en que están conectadas las distintas partes[1]. En este caso, tenemos la forma:

- Si P, entonces Q
- P es verdadero
- Por lo tanto, Q es verdadero

Este patrón de razonamiento es formalmente válido. Un argumento lógico es precisamente un razonamiento que, a partir de proposiciones verdaderas, obtiene conclusiones verdaderas cuando la estructura es correcta[1]. María establece una relación entre aserciones mediante una proposición condicional, y dado que sabemos que la premisa (Susana quiere leer) es verdadera, podemos **validamente concluir** que la conclusión (hay libros en la estantería) también es verdadera[5]."
B9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y no hay libros en la estantería. Tampoco hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","# Análisis de la Afirmación de María

No, de acuerdo con el contexto dado, **no hay libros en la estantería**. Esto se establece explícitamente al comienzo: ""no hay libros en la estantería"".[8]

Sin embargo, existe una contradicción lógica importante que surge de la afirmación de María.

## La Contradicción Lógica

María afirma: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería."" Esta es una proposición condicional que podemos representar como: Si **p** entonces **q**, donde:
- **p** = ""Susana quiere leer"" (VERDADERO, según el contexto)
- **q** = ""hay libros en la estantería"" (FALSO, según el contexto)

Aplicando modus ponens, un esquema formalmente válido de razonamiento, si la premisa es verdadera (Susana quiere leer) y aceptamos como verdadera la afirmación condicional de María, entonces deberíamos concluir que hay libros en la estantería.[5]

Sin embargo, el contexto nos dice que no hay libros en la estantería. Esto significa que **la afirmación de María es falsa**, ya que genera una conclusión que contradice la realidad establecida.

## Conclusión

La respuesta a la pregunta es **NO**: no hay libros en la estantería según los hechos del contexto. Lo que María dice es una afirmación falsa porque afirma un condicional que no se cumple en la realidad."
B9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana no quiere leer. Hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No se puede determinar con certeza basándose únicamente en lo que dice María. María hace una afirmación condicional: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Esto significa que **solo si se cumple la condición** (que Susana quiera leer), entonces hay libros en la estantería.

Sin embargo, según el contexto, **Susana no quiere leer**, por lo que la condición no se cumple. En este caso, la afirmación condicional de María no nos permite concluir nada definitivo sobre si hay libros en la estantería o no.

En lógica, cuando una proposición condicional tiene un antecedente falso (Susana no quiere leer), no podemos deducir nada sobre la veracidad del consecuente (hay libros en la estantería) basándonos solo en esa frase.

Para afirmar con certeza que hay libros en la estantería, necesitaríamos información adicional más allá de lo que María declaró."
F1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque la pizza sea más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más. Hay pizza en la nevera. En este contexto, ¿la pizza es más popular que la pasta?","Sí, según los datos disponibles, **la pizza es más popular que la pasta**.[3] Cuando se trata de pedir comida para llevar, los españoles prefieren una buena pizza frente a un plato de pasta.[3]

Esta preferencia se mantiene incluso considerando el factor económico que mencionas. Aunque la pizza sea más cara, su mayor demanda sugiere que los consumidores la valoran especialmente o la asocian con momentos específicos de consumo. Esto contrasta con la pasta, que tiende a percibirse más como un plato improvisado y cotidiano.[5]

Ambos platos tienen su lugar en la cocina italiana, considerada una de las más variadas y populares del mundo,[7] pero cuando se analiza el comportamiento de compra actual, la pizza destaca como la opción preferida."
F1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque la pizza sea más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más. Hay pizza en la nevera. En este contexto, ¿la pasta es más popular que la pizza?","No, la pasta no es más popular que la pizza. De hecho, el contexto que proporcionas indica lo contrario: aunque la pizza es más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más. Esto sugiere que la pizza tiene mayor demanda y preferencia entre los consumidores, independientemente de su precio más elevado.

Esta tendencia se confirma también en estudios sobre preferencias culinarias, donde se observa que los españoles, por ejemplo, prefieren la pizza sobre la pasta a la hora de pedir comida para llevar[9]. Mientras que la pasta se asocia más con un plato improvisado para el día a día, la pizza se entiende como una opción más celebratoria, lo que puede influir en su mayor popularidad en ciertos contextos[3]."
F2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera. En este contexto, ¿se utiliza más el té verde que el café negro?","Según el contexto que proporcionaste, donde se menciona que ""la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde"", la respuesta sería que sí, en esa situación específica se utilizaría más el té verde que el café negro.

Sin embargo, es importante notar que esto varía significativamente según la región geográfica. A nivel global, los patrones de consumo son muy distintos: en Estados Unidos se consume un 75,4% de café contra un 25,6% de té[17], mientras que en China ocurre lo opuesto, con un 1,1% de café contra un 98,9% de té[17]. 

De manera general, el té es la segunda bebida más consumida a nivel mundial, solo detrás del agua[7], lo que sugiere que a escala global el té tiene una presencia significativa. No obstante, en contextos específicos donde ""la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde"", como se describe en tu escenario, el consumo de té verde sería superior al del café negro, a pesar de que el café sea más económico."
F2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera.

Según lo que indicas, aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, **la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde**. Esto sugiere que se utiliza más té verde que café negro, no lo contrario.

La preferencia de la mayoría de las personas por el té verde indicaría un mayor consumo de esta bebida a pesar de su mayor costo. El hecho de que haya café negro disponible en la cafetera no necesariamente refleja patrones de uso más amplios.

Los resultados de búsqueda no contienen información específica sobre estadísticas globales de consumo entre café negro y té verde, pero el contexto que proporcionas claramente apunta a que el té verde es más preferido y, por tanto, probablemente más utilizado que el café negro."
F3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿los refrescos tienen más demanda que el agua?","No, los refrescos no tienen más demanda que el agua. De hecho, la tendencia es completamente opuesta.

En **Estados Unidos**, el consumo de agua embotellada ha superado por primera vez al de los refrescos. El consumo per cápita anual de agua embotellada se estableció en 147.6 litros, mientras que el consumo de refrescos fue de 145.7 litros.[1] Además, el consumo de agua ha crecido año tras año, mientras que durante los últimos 11 años el volumen del consumo de refrescos ha ido disminuyendo constantemente.[1]

En **España**, la situación es similar. El agua embotellada es la bebida más consumida con un 46% del total del consumo, por delante de los refrescos y los zumos.[7] El consumo de agua envasada en España alcanzó 120 litros por persona, significativamente más que los refrescos, que representaron 94.7 litros per cápita.[9]

A nivel **europeo**, el agua mineral es la bebida no alcohólica más consumida, con un 48% del total, seguida de los refrescos con un 39%.[13]

Esta tendencia refleja un cambio en las preferencias de los consumidores hacia bebidas más asociadas con la salud. Un 86% de los consumidores estadounidenses compra agua de forma regular, un porcentaje que sigue creciendo conforme los consumidores se preocupan más por la salud.[1]"
F3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿el agua tiene más demanda que los refrescos?","La respuesta depende de cómo se mida la demanda. A nivel global, **el agua es la bebida no alcohólica más consumida del mundo año tras año**[13], superando a los refrescos en volumen de consumo. Sin embargo, **los refrescos generan más ingresos económicos para la industria**[13].

En cuanto a las tendencias recientes, la demanda de agua, especialmente agua con gas, ha experimentado un crecimiento significativo. **La demanda de agua con gas está en máximos históricos**, con las personas buscando alternativas más saludables a los refrescos azucarados[1]. Un análisis del mercado reveló una **disminución del 2.9% en el volumen de ventas de refrescos en los principales minoristas de alimentos**[1], mientras que los consumidores están recurriendo cada vez más al agua con gas saborizada como sustituto bajo o sin azúcar de las bebidas gaseosas altamente endulzadas.

En España específicamente, **desde 2013 el consumo de refrescos estaba bajando**[5], aunque experimentó un aumento durante el confinamiento en 2020. En 2024, **los refrescos de cola fueron los más consumidos entre las bebidas no alcohólicas en España**[7].

En conclusión, aunque los refrescos todavía generan importantes ingresos, **el agua tiene mayor demanda en términos de volumen de consumo global**, y esta tendencia se acentúa con el crecimiento del agua con gas y la disminución progresiva del consumo de refrescos tradicionales azucarados."

F5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el sushi sea más sano que las hamburguesas, la gente come hamburguesas con más frecuencia. Hay sushi en la mesa. En este contexto, ¿las hamburguesas son más populares que el sushi?","Sí, según el contexto que proporcionas, las hamburguesas son más populares que el sushi, dado que mencionas explícitamente que ""la gente come hamburguesas con más frecuencia"". 

Los resultados de búsqueda disponibles confirman que tanto las hamburguesas como el sushi se encuentran entre los platos más consumidos en la actualidad[3], y ambos se ofrecen comúnmente como opciones en establecimientos de comida rápida[5]. Sin embargo, tu contexto establece claramente que las hamburguesas tienen un consumo más frecuente entre la población, a pesar de que el sushi sea una opción nutricionalmente más saludable."
F5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el sushi sea más sano que las hamburguesas, la gente come hamburguesas con más frecuencia. Hay sushi en la mesa. En este contexto, ¿el sushi es más popular que las hamburguesas?","No, el sushi no es más popular que las hamburguesas. De hecho, el contexto que proporcionas indica claramente lo contrario: aunque el sushi sea más saludable nutricionalmente, la gente come hamburguesas con mayor frecuencia.

Esto se confirma con los datos disponibles. En Estados Unidos, aproximadamente uno de cada tres estadounidenses consume comida rápida en un día típico[3], siendo las hamburguesas uno de los elementos principales en este tipo de establecimientos. El consumo de hamburguesas es especialmente alto entre los adultos jóvenes, alcanzando el 44.9% en personas de 20 a 30 años[3].

Las hamburguesas se mantienen como uno de los platos más consumidos de todos los tiempos[5], lo que indica su arraigo en los hábitos alimentarios de la población. Aunque el sushi es buscado activamente por turistas en Japón y se considera parte de la cocina japonesa más popular en Estados Unidos[9], su consumo general sigue siendo menor que el de las hamburguesas a nivel mundial.

La razón de esta diferencia no está relacionada con la salubridad del alimento, ya que el sushi, a pesar de su contenido calórico elevado, se considera más nutritivo que las hamburguesas. Más bien, factores como la disponibilidad, la accesibilidad, el precio y la conveniencia de la comida rápida hacen que las hamburguesas sean consumidas con mayor frecuencia por la población general."
F6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más. Hay plátanos en la cesta. En este contexto, ¿los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis?","Sí, según los datos disponibles, los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis. Aunque el kiwi ha sido designado como ""la fruta más saludable del mundo"" por expertos en nutrición debido a su excepcional concentración de nutrientes[1], **el kiwi no es tan popular como otras frutas en algunos países**[1]. En particular, en España, los plátanos figuran entre las preferencias de consumo en todos los grupos de edad, por delante de otras frutas como naranjas y manzanas[3].

Esta diferencia en popularidad no se debe a factores nutricionales, sino a otros aspectos como el costo y la disponibilidad. El kiwi tiene un precio relativamente elevado en comparación con otras frutas más comunes como el plátano[1], lo que influye en las decisiones de compra de los consumidores. A pesar de que el kiwi contenga el doble de vitamina C que las naranjas y ocho veces más nutrientes que las manzanas[1], los plátanos mantienen una mayor preferencia y consumo en el mercado."

**Tendencia reciente**: Aunque los perros siguen siendo muy populares, su número ha disminuido ligeramente en comparación con el crecimiento de los gatos en los últimos años[7].

En conclusión, aunque en España los perros sean más populares que los gatos, a nivel mundial y europeo la tendencia es que los gatos sean la mascota preferida."

Aunque María hizo una declaración condicional (""Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza"") y sabemos que la condición se cumple (el loro sí está en la jaula), esto no es suficiente para garantizar que la consecuencia ocurrió.

En lógica, de una declaración condicional no podemos deducir automáticamente que la conclusión es verdadera solo porque la condición sea cierta. Para poder afirmar con seguridad que Tomás trajo pizza, necesitaríamos información adicional que confirme que:

1. La declaración de María es una promesa o compromiso que se cumplió, o
2. Se ha verificado directamente que Tomás trajo la pizza

La declaración condicional de María solo nos garantiza que **si** el loro estaba en la jaula, **entonces** Tomás traería pizza. Que el loro esté en la jaula es una condición necesaria, pero su cumplimiento no es suficiente por sí solo para confirmar que la acción ocurrió, a menos que tengamos evidencia adicional de que la promesa se realizó."

Además, desde la perspectiva de lo que María dijo, su afirmación condicional resulta ser falsa. Analicemos la estructura lógica de su declaración:[1]

**Estructura de la declaración de María:**
- **Antecedente (p):** ""el loro está en la jaula"" → VERDADERO ✓
- **Consecuente (q):** ""Tomás traerá pizza"" → FALSO ✗

En una proposición condicional de la forma ""Si p, entonces q""[1], cuando el antecedente es verdadero, el consecuente debería serlo también para que la declaración sea válida. En este caso:

- El loro SÍ está en la jaula (la condición se cumple)
- Sin embargo, Tomás NO trajo pizza (el resultado no se produjo)

Por lo tanto, la predicción de María no se cumplió. El hecho de que la condición sea verdadera pero el resultado sea falso demuestra que la afirmación condicional que ella hizo es inconsistente con lo que realmente sucedió.

La respuesta es definitiva: **No, Tomás no trajo pizza.**"
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no se puede determinar con certeza si Tomás trajo pizza.

La afirmación de María es un razonamiento condicional que establece: ""Si el loro está en la jaula, entonces Tomás traerá pizza""[1]. Esta estructura lógica se compone de dos partes: la **proposición antecedente** (""el loro está en la jaula"") y la **proposición consecuente** (""Tomás traerá pizza"")[1].

El punto crucial es que en la lógica, cuando la proposición antecedente es **falsa**, la proposición condicional no nos proporciona información sobre si la consecuente es verdadera o falsa. Como sabemos que el loro **no está en la jaula**, el antecedente de la afirmación de María es falso.

Según la lógica proposicional, de una relación condicional ""Si P, entonces Q"" no se deduce estrictamente ""Si no P, entonces no Q""[3]. Es decir, del hecho de que el loro no esté en la jaula no podemos concluir ni que Tomás trajo pizza ni que no la trajo. La proposición condicional de María es compatible tanto con que Tomás haya traído pizza como con que no la haya traído[3].

En conclusión, la información que María proporcionó es insuficiente para determinar si Tomás trajo pizza. Necesitaríamos información adicional para saberlo con certeza."
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","Según lo que decía María, **sí debería ser verdad** que Marcos te dio un caramelo.

Aquí está la razón:

María expresó una **oración condicional real** (tipo 1) con la estructura: ""Si + presente de indicativo + futuro"". Esta oración establece una relación lógica entre una condición y una consecuencia:[1]

- **Condición:** te comes el brócoli
- **Consecuencia:** Marcos te dará un caramelo

Puesto que **la condición se ha cumplido** (te has comido el brócoli), según la lógica de la oración condicional que María expresó, **la consecuencia debería seguirse**: Marcos debería haberte dado un caramelo.

Sin embargo, es importante notar que lo que María dijo es una **promesa o predicción condicional**, no una confirmación de un hecho ya ocurrido. La oración condicional establece qué *debería* suceder si se cumple la condición, pero la realidad de si Marcos efectivamente te dio el caramelo depende de si él cumplió con lo que María predijo.

En conclusión: De acuerdo con la lógica de lo que María dijo, sí es verdad que *debería* haberte dado el caramelo, porque cumpliste tu parte de la condición."

El contexto establece explícitamente que ""Marcos no te dio un caramelo"", a pesar de que tú sí te comiste el brócoli. Aunque María predijo que si comías brócoli, Marcos te daría un caramelo, esta predicción no se cumplió en la realidad.

María estableció un condicional: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Esta es una promesa que solo se activa si se cumple la condición (comer el brócoli).

Dado que en el contexto se establece que **no te comiste el brócoli**, la condición del enunciado de María nunca se satisfizo. Por lo tanto, no hay base lógica para que Marcos te diera el caramelo. El condicional nunca fue activado, así que la promesa no aplica.

La premisa condicional solo establece una relación entre ""los zorros bailando"" e ""Irene recibiendo una cámara"", sin hacer ninguna afirmación sobre Susana. Por lo tanto, no hay base lógica para concluir que Susana recibió una cámara."
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?","No, no es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara.

Según lo que María dijo, su afirmación era una proposición condicional: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Esta proposición solo hace una afirmación sobre **Susana**, no sobre Irene.

Desglosemos la lógica:

- **Condición**: Los zorros están bailando (verdadero, según el contexto)
- **Consecuencia de María**: Susana recibirá una cámara
- **Lo que sabemos de Irene**: Irene NO recibió una cámara

La declaración de María no establece ninguna relación entre el baile de los zorros y si Irene recibe o no recibe una cámara. Solo vincula el baile de los zorros con que Susana reciba una cámara. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que los zorros estén bailando implica, según María, que Susana recibirá una cámara, pero esto nada dice sobre Irene.

Además, el contexto ya nos indica explícitamente que Irene no recibió una cámara, así que la respuesta es definitivamente **no**."
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No, no es posible determinar si Susana recibió una cámara basándose en la información proporcionada.

La afirmación de María establece un condicional: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Sin embargo, hay dos razones por las que no podemos concluir que Susana recibió una cámara:

1. **El condicional no se cumple**: Como establece el contexto, los zorros no están bailando. Cuando la condición de un condicional es falsa, no podemos sacar conclusiones sobre el resultado.

2. **La afirmación se refiere a Irene, no a Susana**: María específicamente dijo que Irene recibiría una cámara si los zorros danzaban. No hay ninguna información sobre si Susana recibirá o ha recibido una cámara.

Por lo tanto, no tenemos información suficiente para afirmar que Susana recibió una cámara."
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí, según la lógica de lo que María dijo, **es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas**.

Esto se debe a que María estableció una relación condicional: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Dado que se confirma que la televisión **está encendida**, entonces se cumple la condición necesaria para que la consecuencia sea verdadera. Por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, Mateo hizo galletas.

El hecho de que la radio también esté encendida es información adicional que no afecta a esta conclusión lógica, ya que María solo estableció una relación entre el estado de la televisión y las acciones de Mateo."
S4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. Mateo no hizo galletas. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, según la información proporcionada, **no es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas**. El contexto explícitamente afirma que ""Mateo no hizo galletas"".

Lo que ocurrió es que María hizo una afirmación condicional: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Dado que:

- La televisión **está encendida** (la condición se cumple)
- Mateo **no hizo galletas** (el resultado esperado no ocurrió)

Esto significa que el enunciado condicional que María hizo resultó ser **falso**. La predicción o expectativa de María no se cumplió en la realidad. Aunque se cumplía la condición (la televisión estaba encendida), la consecuencia que ella predijo (que Mateo haría galletas) no sucedió."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No, no es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas, según la información proporcionada.

La afirmación de María es un **condicional lógico**: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Esto significa que Mateo hará galletas solo en el caso de que la televisión esté encendida.

Sin embargo, sabemos que **la televisión está apagada**. Dado que el antecedente de la proposición condicional (la televisión está encendida) es falso, no podemos deducir nada sobre el consecuente (Mateo hará galletas).

En otras palabras:
- La proposición de María sigue siendo válida (verdadera) porque nunca establece qué sucede cuando la televisión está apagada
- Pero la ausencia de la televisión encendida significa que no hay ninguna razón lógica para afirmar que Mateo hizo galletas

Por lo tanto, basándose únicamente en lo que María dijo y en los hechos dados, **no podemos afirmar que Mateo hizo galletas**."
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Según la lógica de lo que María dijo, **sí es verdad que Emma fue de morado**.

María planteó una proposición condicional: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado."" Esto establece una relación de causa y efecto donde el tiempo soleado es la **condición** y que Emma vaya de morado es la **consecuencia**.

Dado que en el contexto se establece que hoy el tiempo está soleado (la condición se cumple), podemos concluir lógicamente que Emma irá de morado, tal como María afirmó.

En otras palabras: cuando la condición de la proposición se satisface, la consecuencia debe ser verdadera. Por lo tanto, basándose en lo que decía María, Emma fue de morado."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, no es verdad que Emma fue de morado.

Según la afirmación condicional que hizo María, la estructura era: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado""[1]. Esta es una oración condicional real que establece una relación de causa y consecuencia: si se cumple la condición (que el tiempo esté soleado), entonces debe ocurrir la consecuencia (que Emma vaya de morado).

En este caso, la condición sí se cumplió: el tiempo está soleado. Sin embargo, la consecuencia que María predijo no ocurrió: Emma fue de verde, no de morado. Por lo tanto, lo que María dijo no se hizo realidad. La respuesta correcta es que Emma **no** fue de morado; fue de verde."
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No, no es verdad que Emma fue de morado.

María hizo una afirmación condicional: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Esta es una proposición que solo garantiza que Emma irá de morado en el caso específico de que el tiempo esté soleado.

Sin embargo, el tiempo hoy está lluvioso y hay mucho viento, lo que significa que la condición establecida por María (que el tiempo esté soleado) **no se cumple**. Cuando una condición no se satisface, no podemos sacar conclusiones basadas en esa afirmación condicional.

En otras palabras, la declaración de María solo nos dice qué sucede si llueve de forma soleada, pero no nos dice nada sobre qué hace Emma cuando el tiempo no es soleado. Por lo tanto, basándose únicamente en lo que dijo María, no podemos afirmar que Emma fue de morado."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí, según lo que decía María, es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie.

Esto se deduce por lógica directa: María estableció una condición clara: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Dado que sabemos que el parque infantil **está vacío**, entonces se cumple la condición que María mencionó, por lo que la conclusión lógica es que Júlia se hizo un selfie.

En términos de lógica formal, esto es un ejemplo del razonamiento conocido como *modus ponens*:
- Premisa 1: Si el parque está vacío → Júlia se hace un selfie
- Premisa 2: El parque está vacío
- Conclusión: Por lo tanto, Júlia se hizo un selfie"
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No, no es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie. Según el contexto proporcionado, se establece explícitamente que **""Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie""**.

Aunque María predijo que si el parque infantil estaba vacío, Júlia se haría un selfie, esta predicción no se cumplió en la realidad. El parque infantil sí está vacío, pero Júlia decidió no tomarse un selfie, por lo que María's statement resultó ser incorrecta en este caso.

La respuesta a la pregunta es clara: Júlia **no** se hizo un selfie."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No, no se puede determinar si es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie basándose únicamente en lo que decía María.

María hizo una afirmación condicional: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Esta es una proposición lógica de la forma ""Si A, entonces B"".

Según esta lógica:
- La afirmación solo garantiza que Júlia se hará un selfie cuando el parque está **vacío**
- En el contexto dado, el parque infantil **está lleno**, no vacío
- Por lo tanto, la condición que María especificó no se cumple

Cuando la condición de una afirmación condicional es falsa, no podemos concluir nada sobre el resultado. Júlia podría haberse hecho un selfie o no, pero no podemos saberlo a partir de lo que María dijo, ya que su afirmación solo cubría el escenario en el que el parque estuviera vacío."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No es posible determinar con certeza que Pablo recibió 50 euros basándose en la información proporcionada.

Aunque sabemos que el césped ha sido cortado, la declaración de María establece un condicional: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Para que Pablo reciba el dinero, debe cumplirse la condición de que **Pablo específicamente** sea quien cortó el césped.

El hecho de que el césped esté cortado no nos permite concluir automáticamente que fue Pablo quien lo hizo. Podría haber sido cortado por otra persona. Sin confirmación explícita de que Pablo fue quien realizó la acción, no podemos afirmar que el compromiso de María se cumplió y que Pablo recibió los 50 euros."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No se puede determinar con certeza si Pablo recibió 50 euros basándose únicamente en la información proporcionada.

Aunque es verdad que el césped ha sido cortado, lo que sí sabemos es que la declaración de María es una proposición condicional: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Para que esta condición se cumpla y Pablo reciba los 50 euros, es necesario que se cumplan dos cosas:

1. **El antecedente debe ser verdadero**: Pablo debe ser quien cortó el césped
2. **La consecuencia se sigue**: Entonces recibirá los 50 euros

El problema es que el contexto solo nos dice que ""el césped ha sido cortado"", pero **no especifica quién lo cortó**. Pudieron haberlo cortado:

- Pablo
- María
- Otra persona
- Alguien más del grupo

Si Pablo fue quien cortó el césped, entonces según la promesa de María, sí debería recibir los 50 euros. Pero si otra persona lo cortó, entonces la condición que María estableció no se cumplió, y su promesa no sería aplicable.

Por lo tanto, **sin saber con certeza que Pablo fue quien cortó el césped, no podemos afirmar que es verdad que recibió los 50 euros**."
S7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped no ha sido cortado. Además, las flores no han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No, no es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros.

María estableció una condición: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Esto significa que Pablo solo recibiría los 50 euros en el caso de que cortara el césped. Sin embargo, según el contexto proporcionado, el césped no ha sido cortado, por lo que la condición establecida por María no se ha cumplido. 

Dado que la condición del acuerdo no fue satisfecha (Pablo no cortó el césped), no hay base para afirmar que Pablo recibió la recompensa de 50 euros. La promesa de María solo tenía validez si Pablo completaba la tarea, algo que no ocurrió."
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","De acuerdo con la lógica de inferencia, específicamente aplicando la regla de **Modus Ponens**, sí se puede concluir que Antonio leerá un libro[1].

El razonamiento es el siguiente:

**Premisa 1:** Si el perro está jugando, entonces Antonio leerá un libro (condicional)
**Premisa 2:** El perro está jugando (antecedente verdadero)
**Conclusión:** Antonio leerá un libro (consecuente)

La regla de Modus Ponens establece que si un condicional es verdadero y su antecedente es verdadero, entonces el consecuente también debe ser verdadero[1]. Dado que el perro efectivamente está jugando, y María estableció que esta condición garantiza que Antonio leerá un libro, la conclusión lógica es válida.

Sin embargo, hay una consideración importante sobre el **tiempo verbal**. María dijo que Antonio ""leerá"" un libro (tiempo futuro), por lo que la conclusión lógica es que Antonio **leerá** un libro en el futuro. Tu pregunta, en cambio, utiliza la forma pasada (""¿leyó?""). Por lo tanto, basándose únicamente en lo que María dijo y en el momento presente, podemos afirmar que Antonio **leerá** un libro, pero no podemos confirmar que ya lo haya hecho en el pasado."
S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro. Según el contexto proporcionado, **Antonio no leyó ningún libro**.

Lo que sucedió es que María estableció una proposición condicional: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro""[1]. Esta afirmación tiene una **estructura condicional compuesta por dos partes: una antecedente (la condición) y una consecuente (lo que sucedería si se cumple la condición)**[1].

En este caso:
- **Antecedente**: El perro está jugando (esto es VERDADERO)
- **Consecuente**: Antonio leerá un libro (esto es FALSO)

Cuando el antecedente de una proposición condicional es verdadero pero el consecuente no se cumple, significa que **la predicción de María resultó ser falsa**. En otras palabras, aunque se cumplió la condición (el perro sí estaba jugando), la consecuencia que María predijo no ocurrió (Antonio no leyó un libro).

Por lo tanto, la respuesta directa a tu pregunta es: **No, Antonio no leyó un libro**, tal como se establece explícitamente en el contexto inicial."
S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No, no se puede determinar que sea verdad que Antonio leyó un libro basándose en lo que dijo María.

María hizo una afirmación condicional: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro.""[1] Esta estructura condicional establece una relación entre dos proposiciones: si ocurre la condición (el perro está jugando), entonces ocurriría la consecuencia (Antonio leerá un libro).[1]

Sin embargo, en el contexto dado, **el perro no está jugando**, lo que significa que la condición (el antecedente) es falsa. Cuando el antecedente de una proposición condicional es falso, no podemos deducir nada sobre la consecuencia.[3] 

Como se explica en la lógica condicional, de la relación lógica ""Si P, entonces Q"" no se deduce estrictamente ""Si no P, entonces no Q"".[3] Esto significa que el hecho de que el perro no esté jugando no nos permite afirmar ni negar que Antonio leyó un libro. La declaración condicional de María solo nos informa qué pasaría si el perro estuviera jugando, pero como esa condición no se cumple, no tenemos información que permita determinar si Antonio leyó o no un libro.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta es **no podemos confirmarlo como verdadero** basándonos únicamente en lo que María dijo."
S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Sí, según lo que decía María, es verdad que Ana trajo donuts.

La oración condicional que María expresó establece una relación de causa-efecto: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Esta es una estructura condicional de primer tipo que sigue el patrón **si + presente indicativo + futuro**, utilizándose para hacer predicciones probables.[1]

En el contexto dado:

**La condición se cumple**: la nevera está vacía (tal como se establece en el contexto).

**Conclusión lógica**: Cuando la condición de una oración condicional es verdadera, la consecuencia también debe serlo. Por lo tanto, si la nevera está vacía, entonces Ana trajo donuts, tal como María lo predijo.

En otras palabras, la afirmación de María funciona como una implicación lógica donde la presencia de la condición (nevera vacía) valida la ocurrencia de la acción principal (Ana traerá donuts).[1]"
S9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. Ana no trajo donuts. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, no es verdad que Ana trajo donuts. Según el contexto establecido, **Ana no trajo donuts**, lo cual es un hecho explícito.

## Análisis de la afirmación condicional de María

María afirmó: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts."" Esta es una proposición condicional de la forma P → Q, donde:[1]

- **P** (antecedente): La nevera está vacía = VERDADERO
- **Q** (consecuente): Ana traerá donuts = FALSO

En lógica proposicional, un condicional P → Q establece una relación entre dos proposiciones.[7] Cuando el antecedente es verdadero pero el consecuente es falso, la proposición condicional original resulta ser falsa.

En este caso, aunque se cumple la condición (la nevera sí está vacía), el resultado que María predijo no ocurrió (Ana no trajo donuts). Esto significa que la afirmación de María fue incorrecta o no se cumplió.

Por lo tanto, la respuesta a tu pregunta es **NO**: no es verdad que Ana haya traído donuts. El hecho establecido en el contexto es que Ana no trajo donuts, independientemente de lo que María hubiera predicho."
S9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está llena. Además, el horno está encendido. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No, **no es verdad** que Ana trajo donuts según lo que decía María, ni tampoco podemos afirmar que no lo hizo.

## Análisis lógico

El enunciado de María es un condicional: **""Si la nevera está vacía, entonces Ana traerá donuts""**[1].

En lógica, esta estructura se expresa como:
- Antecedente (condición): La nevera está vacía
- Consecuente (conclusión): Ana traerá donuts

Sin embargo, **sabemos que la nevera está llena**, no vacía. Esto significa que el antecedente del condicional es **falso**.

## Aplicación de reglas de inferencia

Cuando tenemos un condicional y el antecedente no se cumple, no podemos extraer ninguna conclusión válida sobre el consecuente[1]. La declaración de María solo nos dice qué ocurriría si se cumpliera su condición (que la nevera estuviera vacía). Dado que esa condición no existe, el condicional no nos permite afirmar nada sobre si Ana trajo o no los donuts.

## Conclusión

Según lo que decía María, **la información es insuficiente** para determinar si Ana trajo donuts. Su afirmación solo tenía aplicación en el caso de que la nevera estuviera vacía, pero ese escenario no es el caso."
