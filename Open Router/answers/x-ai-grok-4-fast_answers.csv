B1T,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is pizza in the oven. There is also pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?",Yes
B1F,English,"Here's the context: John is hungry and there is no pizza in the oven. There is no pasta in the fridge either. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning follows these steps based on classical logic:

1. Identify the key facts from the context: John is hungry (true), and there is no pizza in the oven (false). The detail about pasta is irrelevant and can be ignored.

2. Interpret Mary's statement as a conditional: ""If John is hungry (P), then there is pizza in the oven (Q)"", or P → Q.

3. In logic, a conditional P → Q is false only when P is true and Q is false. Here, P is true and Q is false, so Mary's statement is false.

4. The question asks specifically whether ""there is pizza in the oven"" (Q) is true. Based on the explicit context, Q is false.

5. Therefore, the conclusion is that it is not true that there is pizza in the oven, regardless of the truth of Mary's statement."
B1C,English,"Here's the context: John is not hungry. There is pasta in the fridge. Mary says: ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is pizza in the oven?","No

The statement ""If John is hungry, there is pizza in the oven"" is a conditional. Since John is not hungry, the conditional holds (it's vacuously true), but it provides no information about whether there is actually pizza in the oven. The pasta in the fridge is irrelevant."
B2T,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is aspirin on the table. There is also ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table? ",Yes.
B2F,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head hurts and there is no aspirin on the table. There is no ibuprofen in the drawer either. Mary says:  ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?",No. There is no aspirin on the table.
B2C,English,"Here's the context: Nicole's head does not hurt. There is ibuprofen in the drawer. Mary says: ""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is aspirin on the table?","No

The conditional statement (""If Nicole's head hurts, there is aspirin on the table"") does not imply anything about the presence of aspirin when Nicole's head does not hurt, as the antecedent of the conditional is false. Thus, we cannot conclude that there is aspirin on the table."
B3T,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is water in the fridge. There is also apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","Yes. Mary's statement is a conditional (""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge""). Since the context confirms that Lucy is thirsty, her statement logically implies that there is water in the fridge (modus ponens)."
B3F,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is thirsty and there is no water in the fridge. There is no apple juice on the shelf either. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning process evaluates the given context and Mary's statement to determine the truth of the claim that there is water in the fridge. 

First, the context establishes two key facts: Lucy is thirsty, and there is no water in the fridge. This directly indicates that the claim ""there is water in the fridge"" is false.

Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge."" In logical terms, this is ""If P (Lucy is thirsty), then Q (there is water in the fridge)."" The context confirms P is true but Q is false, making the conditional false, as a true antecedent with a false consequent violates the implication.

The phrase ""based on what Mary says"" requires assessing whether her statement supports the claim. However, the context provides explicit evidence that contradicts the consequent of her statement. Thus, regardless of the conditional, the factual information from the context overrides it, confirming that there is no water in the fridge.

The mention of no apple juice is irrelevant and does not affect the evaluation."
B3C,English,"Here's the context: Lucy is not thirsty. There is apple juice on the shelf. Mary says: ""If Lucy is thirsty, there is water in the fridge"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is water in the fridge? ","No

The conditional statement ""If Lucy is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge"" does not provide information about whether there is water in the fridge when Lucy is not thirsty. The presence of apple juice is irrelevant."
B4T,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is a charger in the drawer. There is also a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","Yes

Mary's conditional statement (""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"") is true given the context (where Peter's phone *is* dead). By modus ponens, it follows that there is a charger in the drawer."
B4F,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is dead and there is no charger in the drawer. There is no computer on the table either. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No.

The context explicitly states there is no charger in the drawer, making Mary's conditional statement false (since the antecedent ""Peter's phone is dead"" is true but the consequent is false). Mary's statement does not change the given facts."
B4C,English,"Here's the context: Peter's phone is fully charged. There is a computer on the table. Mary says: ""If Peter's phone is dead, there is a charger in the drawer"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a charger in the drawer?","No

The conditional statement from Mary (""If Peter's phone is dead, then there is a charger in the drawer"") does not provide information about the existence of the charger when the phone is fully charged (i.e., the condition is false). The presence of the computer on the table is irrelevant."
B5T,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is an umbrella on the coat rack. There is also a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","Yes.

Mary's statement is the conditional ""If the weather is rainy, then there is an umbrella on the coat rack."" The context confirms the weather is rainy, so by modus ponens (affirming the antecedent), her statement implies there is an umbrella on the coat rack."
B5F,English,"Here's the context: The weather is rainy and there is no umbrella on the coat rack. There is no raincoat in the car either. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No

Mary's statement (""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"") is logically false given the context that it is rainy but there is no umbrella. The context directly states there is no umbrella on the coat rack, so it is not true that there is one."
B5C,English,"Here's the context: The weather is sunny. There is a raincoat in the car. Mary says: ""If the weather is rainy, there is an umbrella on the coat rack"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an umbrella on the coat rack?","No

The weather is sunny (not rainy), so Mary's conditional statement (""If rainy, then umbrella on coat rack"") is vacuously true but provides no information about whether there actually is an umbrella. Her statement alone does not entail or prove that there is one."
B6T,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is a pump in the garage. There is also a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","Yes

Mary's statement is a conditional: If the tire is flat (true, per context), then there is a pump in the garage. Assuming the statement is true, it follows that there is a pump in the garage."
B6F,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is flat and there is no pump in the garage. There is no bike by the front door either. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?",No.
B6C,English,"Here's the context: Your tire is not flat. There is a bike by the front door. Mary says: ""If your tire is flat, there is a pump in the garage"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a pump in the garage?","No

The conditional statement (""If your tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage"") provides no information about the existence of a pump when the tire is known not to be flat. The truth of the pump's existence cannot be affirmed based on Mary's statement under these conditions."
B7T,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is a water can on the shelf. There is also a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","Yes

The context explicitly states that there is a water can on the shelf (and the plant is dry), which directly confirms the fact. Mary's conditional statement is true under these circumstances but is not needed to establish the presence of the water can."
B7F,English,"Here's the context: The plant is dry and there is no water can on the shelf. There is no hose in the garden either. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ",No. The context explicitly states that there is no water can on the shelf.
B7C,English,"Here's the context: The plant is not dry. There is a hose in the garden. Mary says: ""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is a water can on the shelf? ","No

The plant is not dry, so Mary's conditional statement (""If the plant is dry, there is a water can on the shelf"") does not apply and provides no information about whether there is a water can on the shelf. The hose is irrelevant."
B8T,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is an iron in the closet. There is also an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","Yes

Mary's statement is a conditional: If the shirt is wrinkled (true, per context), then there is an iron in the closet. Assuming the conditional is true, the consequent must hold, so there is an iron in the closet. (The additional detail about the ironing board is irrelevant.)"
B8F,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is wrinkled and there is no iron in the closet. There is no ironing board on the balcony either. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning follows logical analysis of the provided context and Mary's statement:

1. The context states two key facts: George's shirt is wrinkled (true) and there is no iron in the closet (false). This establishes the actual situation.

2. Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, then there is an iron in the closet,"" which can be denoted as P → Q, where P is ""shirt is wrinkled"" and Q is ""there is an iron in the closet.""

3. Since P is true and Q is false, the conditional P → Q does not hold, making Mary's statement false.

4. The question asks whether it is true that there is an iron in the closet, specifically based on what Mary says. However, the context overrides any implication from Mary's false statement, confirming that no iron exists.

5. Thus, the conclusion is that there is no iron in the closet, as directly stated in the context."
B8C,English,"Here's the context: George's shirt is not wrinkled. There is an ironing board on the balcony. Mary says: ""If George's shirt is wrinkled, there is an iron in the closet"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there is an iron in the closet?","No, Mary's statement does not imply that there is an iron in the closet, since George's shirt is not wrinkled (making the conditional vacuously true but providing no information about the consequent)."
B9T,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are books on the shelf. There is also a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","Yes

The context confirms that Susy wants to read, making the antecedent of Mary's conditional statement true. The conditional therefore affirms that there are books on the shelf."
B9F,English,"Here's the context: Susy wants to read and there are no books on the shelf. There is no newspaper on the couch either. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning follows a step-by-step logical analysis based on the provided context and Mary's statement.

1. **Identify key elements from the context**: The context establishes two facts: Susy wants to read (denoted as P: true), and there are no books on the shelf (denoted as Q: false). The detail about the newspaper is irrelevant to the question.

2. **Interpret Mary's statement**: Mary states, ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf,"" which is a conditional implication in logical terms: P → Q (If P, then Q).

3. **Evaluate the truth of the implication**: In logic, an implication P → Q is false only when P is true and Q is false. Here, P is true (Susy wants to read) and Q is false (no books on the shelf), so Mary's statement is false.

4. **Address the question's focus**: The question asks whether it is true that there are books on the shelf (i.e., is Q true?), specifically ""based on what Mary says."" Mary's false statement does not alter the factual context, which directly states Q is false. Thus, Mary's claim cannot be taken as evidence that books are present; it is contradicted by the established facts.

5. **Conclude based on the evidence**: The context provides the definitive information, leading to the determination that there are no books on the shelf."
B9C,English,"Here's the context: Susy does not want to read. There is a newspaper on the couch. Mary says: ""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that there are books on the shelf?","No

The conditional statement by Mary (""If Susy wants to read, there are books on the shelf"") does not entail that there are actually books on the shelf. Since Susy does not want to read (making the antecedent false), the truth of the consequent is undetermined by the statement."
F1T,English,"Here's the context: Although pizza is more expensive than pasta, people buy it more. There is pizza in the fridge. In this context, is pizza more popular than pasta?","Yes

The context states that people buy pizza more than pasta despite its higher cost, which directly indicates greater popularity."

F4T,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context, is broccoli more popular than gnocchi?","Yes

The context states that people use broccoli more than gnocchi (despite it being more difficult to cook), which implies greater popularity in terms of common usage."
F4F,English,"Here's the context: Although broccoli is more difficult to cook than gnocchi, people use it more. There is broccoli in the oven. In this context,  are gnocchi more popular than broccoli?","No, gnocchi are not more popular than broccoli. The context states that people use broccoli more than gnocchi, implying greater popularity for broccoli."
F5T,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, are burgers more popular than sushi?","Yes, based on the context that people eat burgers more often."
F5F,English,"Here's the context: Although sushi is healthier than burgers, people eat burgers more often. There is sushi on the table. In this context, is sushi more popular than burgers?",No
F6T,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are bananas more popular than kiwis?","Yes, based on the context, bananas are more popular than kiwis because people purchase them more despite the higher price."
F6F,English,"Here's the context: Although bananas are more expensive than kiwis, people purchase them more. There are bananas in the basket. In this context, are kiwis more popular than bananas?","No, bananas are more popular than kiwis, as people purchase them more despite the higher cost."

F8T,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people watching TV than reading books?",Yes.
F8F,English,"Here's the context: Although reading books is more educational than watching TV, most people watch TV. There is a book on the shelf. In this context, are more people reading books than watching TV?","No

The context explicitly states that ""most people watch TV,"" which implies that fewer people read books by comparison. The detail about a book on the shelf is irrelevant to the number of people engaging in each activity."
F9T,English,"Here's the context: Although running is better for fitness than walking, most people prefer walking. There is a runner on the track. In this context, is walking more popular than running?","Yes, according to the context, most people prefer walking over running."
F9F,English,"Here's the context: Although running is better for fitness than walking, most people prefer walking. There is a runner on the track. In this context, is running more popular than walking?","No, running is not more popular than walking."
S1T,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?",Yes
S1F,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is in the cage. Also, the dog is in the doghouse. Thomas did not bring pizza. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?",No
S1C,English,"Here's the context: The parrot is not in the cage. The dog is not in the doghouse either. Mary had said: ""If the parrot is in the cage, Thomas will bring pizza"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Thomas brought pizza?","No, it is not necessarily true that Thomas brought pizza. The conditional statement only applies if the parrot is in the cage, which it is not, so the information provided does not determine whether Thomas brought pizza."
S2T,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","Yes

## Explanation

The reasoning follows logical deduction from the given conditional statement. Mary's statement establishes a clear implication: ""If you finish your broccoli (P), then Mark will give you a candy (Q)."" This forms a true conditional (P → Q). The context confirms that P is true, as you finished your broccoli. In logic, when the antecedent (P) of a true conditional is satisfied, the consequent (Q) must follow, leading to the conclusion that Mark gave you the candy. The mention of finishing pasta is irrelevant, as it does not affect the conditional. Thus, based solely on Mary's statement and the facts provided, the claim holds true."
S2F,English,"Here's the context: You finished your broccoli. You also finished your pasta. Mary did not give you a candy. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning follows logical implication based on the given context. Mary's statement forms a conditional: If you finish your broccoli (P), then Mark will give you a candy (Q). In logical terms, this is ""P → Q"".

- The context confirms P is true, as broccoli was finished.
- Mary's statement implies that if P holds, then Q must follow for the conditional to be satisfied.
- However, the context provides no direct evidence that Q occurred (i.e., Mark actually gave the candy). It only reports unrelated facts, such as finishing pasta and Mary not giving candy, which do not affect the conditional.
- The question asks whether it is true that Mark gave the candy, based solely on Mary's statement and the facts. Since the conditional does not guarantee Q's occurrence without additional confirmation, and no such confirmation exists in the context, it cannot be affirmed as true.
- Therefore, the conclusion is that Mark giving the candy is not established as true, leading to the answer ""No""."
S2C,English,"Here's the context: You didn't finish your broccoli. You didn't finish your pasta either. Mary had said: ""If you finish your broccoli, Mark will give you a candy"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Mark gave you a candy?","No

The condition for receiving candy (finishing the broccoli) was not met, so Mark did not give you a candy."
S3T,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?",Yes.
S3F,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are dancing. Also, the squirrels are eating. Susan did not get a shovel. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?",Yes
S3C,English,"Here's the context: The foxes are not dancing. The squirrels are not eating either. Mary had said: ""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Susan got a camera?","No

The conditional statement from Mary (""If the foxes are dancing, Susan will get a camera"") does not imply that Susan got a camera, since the foxes are not dancing. The antecedent is false, so there is no basis—logical or otherwise—for concluding that the consequent (Susan getting a camera) is true."
S4T,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","Yes.

Mary's conditional statement (""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"") is satisfied by the given fact that the TV is on, so Matthew baked cookies (with the radio detail being irrelevant)."
S4F,English,"Here's the context: The TV is on. The radio is also on. Matthew did not bake cookies. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No

## Explanation

The reasoning follows logical analysis of the conditional statement and given facts:

1. Mary's statement is a conditional: ""If the TV is on, then Matthew will bake cookies,"" represented as P → Q, where P is ""the TV is on"" and Q is ""Matthew bakes cookies.""

2. The facts establish that P is true (the TV is on) and Q is false (Matthew did not bake cookies).

3. The question specifically asks whether it is true that Matthew baked cookies, which directly corresponds to Q.

4. Since Q is false based on the provided facts, the conclusion is that it is not true that Matthew baked cookies.

5. Mary's statement and the radio being on do not alter the evaluation of Q, as the query focuses solely on the occurrence of cookie baking."
S4C,English,"Here's the context: The TV is off. The radio is also off. Mary had said: ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Matthew baked cookies?","No

The statement ""If the TV is on, Matthew will bake cookies"" is a conditional that only applies when the TV is on. Since the TV is off, the condition is not met, and Mary's statement provides no information about whether Matthew baked cookies. Therefore, it is not true that he did (we cannot conclude that he baked them based on the given information)."
S5T,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?",Yes.
S5F,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is sunny. Also, there is no wind. Emma is wearing green. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?",No
S5C,English,"Here's the context: Today, the weather is rainy. Also, it is very windy. Mary had said: ""If the weather is sunny, Emma will wear purple"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Emma wore purple?","No

The weather is rainy (not sunny), so Mary's conditional statement (""If sunny, then Emma wears purple"") provides no information about what Emma wore today. We cannot conclude that she wore purple."
S6T,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?",Yes.
S6F,English,"Here's the context: The playground is empty.  Also, the streets are quiet. Angela did not take a selfie. Mary had said: ""If the playground is empty, Angela will take a selfie"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Angela took a selfie?",No.

S7T,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No

The lawn was mowed, but there's no information confirming that Paul was the one who mowed it (as opposed to someone else). Mary's conditional statement (""If Paul mows the lawn, then he will get 50 euros"") doesn't apply unless Paul specifically mowed it, so we can't conclude he got the money. The detail about the flowers being watered is irrelevant."
S7F,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has been mowed. Also, the flowers have been watered. Paul did not get 50 euros. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?",No
S7C,English,"Here's the context: The lawn has not been mowed. Also, the flowers still need watering. Mary had said: ""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Paul got 50 euros?","No

The conditional promise (""If Paul mows the lawn, he will get 50 euros"") was not fulfilled, as the lawn was not mowed. Therefore, Paul did not get 50 euros."
S8T,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?",Yes.
S8F,English,"Here's the context: The dog is playing. Also, the cat is climbing the tree. Anthony did not read a book. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?",No
S8C,English,"Here's the context: The dog is not playing. Also, the cat is sleeping. Mary had said: ""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Anthony read a book?","No

The given information states that the dog is not playing, which means the condition in Mary's statement (""If the dog is playing, Anthony will read a book"") does not apply. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that Anthony read (or did not read) a book. It is not true that he did so based on the provided details."
S9T,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","Yes. Mary's conditional statement (""If the fridge is empty, then Amy will bring donuts"") is true, and the antecedent (fridge is empty) is true, so the consequent (Amy brought donuts) must be true. The status of the oven is irrelevant."
S9F,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is empty. Also, the oven is broken. Amy did not bring donuts. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?",No
S9C,English,"Here's the context: The fridge is full. Also, the oven is on. Mary had said: ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"". Based on what Mary says, is it true that Amy brought donuts?","No

The conditional statement ""If the fridge is empty, Amy will bring donuts"" does not imply that Amy brought donuts when the fridge is full (i.e., the condition is not met). The oven's status is irrelevant."

Explicació: L'afirmació de la Maria és una condicional (""Si la Núria té mal de cap, hi ha aspirines sobre la taula""). Com que la Núria no té mal de cap (l'antecedent és fals), aquesta condicional no implica res sobre la presència d'aspirines sobre la taula. Per tant, no es pot concloure que hi hagi aspirines allà segons el que diu la Maria."

La declaració de la Maria és una condicional (si P, llavors Q), i el context confirma que P (la Llúcia té set) i Q (hi ha aigua a la nevera) són veritables. Per tant, segons el que diu la Maria i el context proporcionat, és veritat que hi ha aigua a la nevera."

**Explanation**: L'afirmació de la Maria és una condicional (""Si P, llavors Q""), on P (""la Llúcia té set"") és falsa segons el context. Una condicional amb antecedent fals no implica res sobre Q (""hi ha aigua a la nevera""). Per tant, no podem concloure que Q sigui veritat segons el que diu la Maria; no hi ha informació suficient per afirmar-ho."
B4T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: El mòbil del Pere no té bateria i hi ha un carregador al calaix. També hi ha un ordinador sobre la taula.

La Maria diu: ""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha un carregador al calaix?","Sí

**Explicació:** Segons l'enunciat de la Maria (""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix""), i donat que el context confirma que el mòbil no té bateria, la seva afirmació implica que sí que hi ha un carregador al calaix."

Explicació: L'afirmació de la Maria és condicional (""Si el mòbil del Pere no té bateria, hi ha un carregador al calaix""), no una afirmació directa de l'existència del carregador. Com que el mòbil del Pere està carregat (segons el context), la condició no s'escau, i no es pot concloure que hi hagi un carregador al calaix."

La declaració de la Maria és una condicional (""Si P, llavors Q"") on P (""el temps és plujós"") és falsa (el temps és serè). Això no implica que Q (""hi ha un paraigua al paraigüer"") sigui certa, per la qual cosa no es pot concloure que hi hagi un paraigua allà."

La declaració de la Maria és una condicional que, donada la premissa del context (la roda punxada), implica l'existència de l'inflador al garatge."

**Explanation:** Maria's statement is a conditional (""If the tire is punctured, then there is an inflator in the garage""). The context states the tire is inflated (not punctured), so the condition is not met. Therefore, her statement does not confirm or establish that there is an inflator in the garage."

La Maria diu: ""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria"". Segons el que diu la Maria, és veritat que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria?","Sí

**Explicació breu:** Segons l'estatament de la Maria (""Si la planta està seca, hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria""), i donat que el context confirma que la planta està seca, per modus ponens lògic, se'n dedueix que hi ha una regadora a la prestatgeria."

La declaració de la Maria és una condicional hipotètica (""Si... llavors...""), que no afirma directament l'existència de llibres a l'estanteria. Com que la Susanna no vol llegir, la condicional no proporciona informació sobre si hi ha llibres o no. Per tant, no es pot concloure que sigui veritat."
F1T,Catalan,"Aquí tens el context: Tot i que la pizza és més cara que la pasta, la gent la compra més. Hi ha pizza a la nevera. En aquest context, la pizza és més popular que la pasta?","Sí, segons el context, la pizza és més popular que la pasta perquè, tot i ser més cara, la gent la compra més."

**Explicació lògica breu:** L'estatament de la Maria és un condicional: ""Si el lloro és a la gàbia (P), llavors el Tomàs portarà pizza (Q)"" (P → Q). Sabem que el lloro no és a la gàbia (¬P), però això no implica res sobre Q: el condicional es compleix vacuousment quan P és fals, independentment de si Q és vera o falsa. Per tant, no es pot concloure que el Tomàs hagi portat pizza; no és veritat basant-se en la informació donada. (La menció al gos sembla irrellevant, possiblement una distracció.)"

La declaració de la Maria és una condicional: si les guineus ballen (P), la Júlia rebrà la càmera (Q). Com que les guineus no ballen (¬P), no es compleix l'antecedent, i la condicional no implica que Q sigui cert. Per tant, no es pot concloure que la Júlia hagi rebut la càmera."

The statement from Maria is a conditional (""If the TV is on, then Mateu will make cookies""). Since the TV is off, the conditional does not apply, and her statement provides no information about whether Mateu has made cookies. Therefore, it is not true (based on her statement) that he has."

**Explanation:** Segons la declaració de la Maria, l'Emma aniria de morat només si el temps és assolellat. Com que avui plou i fa vent (no és assolellat), no hi ha cap indicació que l'Emma vagi de morat. La condicional no implica res sobre el cas contrari."

The conditional statement from Maria (""If Pau mows the grass, he will receive 50 euros"") does not guarantee that Pau received the money, especially since the grass was not mowed (making the condition false). The context provides no evidence that he received it anyway."

The conditional statement from Maria (""If the dog is playing, then Antoni will read a book"") does not imply that Antoni has read a book, since the dog is not playing.

B1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Gianni non ha fame. C'è della pasta in frigo. Maria dice: ""Se Gianni ha fame, c'è della pizza in forno"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è della pizza in forno?","No

The conditional statement (""If Gianni is hungry, there's pizza in the oven"") does not imply the existence of pizza when the condition (Gianni being hungry) is false. Since Gianni is not hungry, Maria's statement provides no information about whether there is pizza in the oven. Thus, it is not true that there is pizza in the oven based on what Maria says."
B2T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo. C'è anche dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?",Yes.
B2F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Nicoletta ha mal di testa e non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo. Non c'è nemmeno dell'ibuprofene nel cassetto. Maria dice: ""Se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo?","No

Spiegazione: Dal contesto fornito, è esplicitamente indicato che non ci sono aspirine sul tavolo. L'affermazione di Maria (se Nicoletta ha mal di testa, allora ci sono aspirine sul tavolo) è un'implicazione logica (MdT → A), ma poiché MdT è vera e A è falsa, l'implicazione è falsa. Tuttavia, la domanda riguarda direttamente la verità di A, che è negata dal contesto."

La dichiarazione di Maria è una implicazione condizionale (""Se P, allora Q""), dove P è ""Nicoletta ha mal di testa"" (falso, dal contesto) e Q è ""ci sono delle aspirine sul tavolo"". Poiché l'antecedente (P) è falso, la condizionale è vera indipendentemente dal valore di Q, ma non implica che Q sia vero. Non c'è informazione che confermi la presenza delle aspirine, quindi non è vero che ci sono."
B3T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e c'è dell'acqua in frigo. C'è anche del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","Yes

The statement from Maria is a conditional (""If Lucia is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge""). Given the context that Lucia is indeed thirsty, this logically implies that there is water in the fridge."
B3F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia ha sete e non c'è dell'acqua in frigo. Non c'è nemmeno del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","No

The context explicitly states that there is no water in the fridge, regardless of Maria's conditional statement (which is false, since Lucia is thirsty but there is no water). Maria's words do not change the factual situation."
B3C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Lucia non ha sete. C'è del succo di mela sullo scaffale. Maria dice: ""Se Lucia ha sete, c'è dell'acqua in frigo"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è dell'acqua in frigo?","No

The statement by Maria is a conditional (""If Lucia is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge""). Since Lucia is not thirsty, the conditional does not provide information about whether there actually is water in the fridge—it neither confirms nor denies it. Therefore, it is not true (based on Maria's statement) that there is water in the fridge."
B4T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. C'è anche un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","Yes

The statement from Maria is a conditional: If Pietro's phone is dead (true in the context), then there is a charger in the drawer. Since the antecedent is true and the conditional holds, the consequent must be true (modus ponens)."
B4F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è scarico e non c'è un caricatore nel cassetto. Non c'è nemmeno un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","No

The context explicitly states that there is no charger in the drawer. Maria's conditional statement (""If the phone is dead, then there is a charger"") does not change this fact, as it evaluates to false given the true premise (dead phone) and false conclusion (no charger)."
B4C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il telefono di Pietro è carico. C'è un computer sul tavolo. Maria dice: ""Se il telefono di Pietro è scarico, c'è un caricatore nel cassetto"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un caricatore nel cassetto?","No, non è possibile concludere che ci sia un caricatore nel cassetto. L'affermazione di Maria è un'implicazione condizionale (""se scarico, allora caricatore""), che è vera dato che il telefono è carico (l'antecedente è falso), ma non fornisce informazioni sul caricatore in questo caso."
B5T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è piovoso e c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli. C'è anche un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?",Sì.

Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No. Il contesto afferma esplicitamente che non c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli, e l'affermazione di Maria (se piove, c'è un ombrello) è falsa, poiché piove ma l'ombrello manca."
B5C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il tempo è sereno. C'è un impermeabile in macchina. Maria dice: ""Se il tempo è piovoso, c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli?","No

Maria's statement is a conditional: se il tempo è piovoso (P), allora c'è un ombrello nel portaombrelli (Q), ovvero P → Q. Poiché il tempo è sereno (¬P), non si può dedurre Q; il condizionale non implica l'esistenza dell'ombrello in questo caso."
B6T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e c'è una pompa in garage. C'è anche una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","Sì

**Spiegazione breve:** Il contesto afferma che la gomma è a terra (premissa A vera), e Maria dice ""Se A, allora c'è una pompa in garage"" (A → B, che è vera). Per modus ponens (A vera + A → B vera implica B vera), sì, c'è una pompa in garage."
B6F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è a terra e non c'è nessuna pompa in garage. Non c'è nemmeno una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No

### Spiegazione logica:
- Dal contesto fornito, è esplicitamente indicato che **non c'è nessuna pompa in garage**.
- L'affermazione di Maria (""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"") è un'implicazione condizionale (A → B, dove A = gomma a terra, B = pompa in garage).
- Poiché A è vero (gomma a terra) e B è falso (non c'è pompa), l'implicazione di Maria risulta falsa.
- Pertanto, in base ai fatti del contesto, non è vero che c'è una pompa in garage. L'affermazione di Maria non altera i fatti oggettivi forniti."
B6C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La gomma della macchina è gonfia. C'è una bici vicino alla porta d'ingresso. Maria dice: ""Se la gomma della macchina è a terra, c'è una pompa in garage"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è una pompa in garage?","No

The conditional statement from Maria (""If the tire is flat, then there is a pump in the garage"") does not apply here because the tire is inflated (not flat). Therefore, her statement provides no information about whether a pump actually exists in the garage. We cannot conclude that there is one."
B7T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. C'è anche un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?",Sì
B7F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è secca e non c'è nessun annaffiatoio sullo scaffale. Non c'è nemmeno un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?",No
B7C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La pianta è rigogliosa. C'è un tubo da giardinaggio in giardino. Maria dice: ""Se la pianta è secca, c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un annaffiatoio sullo scaffale?","No, non è vero. La dichiarazione di Maria è condizionale e si applica solo se la pianta è secca, ma dal contesto la pianta è rigogliosa (non secca), quindi non implica l'esistenza dell'annaffiatoio sullo scaffale."
B8T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. C'è anche un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","Sì

Maria afferma una implicazione (se P, allora Q), e dal contesto si sa che P è vera (la camicia è stropicciata). Quindi, per modus ponens, Q è vera: c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio."
B8F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata e non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non c'è nemmeno un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No

### Ragionamento
- Il contesto fattuale stabilisce chiaramente che **non c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio**.
- L'affermazione di Maria è un'implicazione logica (""Se P, allora Q""), dove P (""la camicia è stropicciata"") è vera, ma Q (""c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"") è falsa. Quindi, l'implicazione di Maria è falsa nel mondo reale.
- ""In base a quello che dice Maria"" non implica accettare l'affermazione come vera; al contrario, il contesto fornito contraddice Q direttamente. Non si può dedurre che sia vero solo da un'affermazione errata."
B8C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: La camicia di Giorgio è stirata. C'è un'asse da stiro in balcone. Maria dice: ""Se la camicia di Giorgio è stropicciata, c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio?","No

La dichiarazione di Maria è un condizionale (""Se la camicia è stropicciata, allora c'è un ferro da stiro nell'armadio""). Poiché la camicia è stirata (non stropicciata), l'ipotesi del condizionale è falsa, e questo non implica nulla sulla presenza del ferro da stiro nell'armadio. Non abbiamo informazioni sufficienti per affermare che sia vero."
B9T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna vuole leggere e ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale. C'è anche un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?",Sì

The context explicitly states there are no books on the shelf, making Maria's conditional statement false (since Susanna does want to read, but the condition she mentions doesn't hold)."
B9C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Susanna non vuole leggere. C'è un giornale sul divano. Maria dice: ""Se Susanna vuole leggere, ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che ci sono dei libri sullo scaffale?","No

The conditional statement by Maria (""If Susanna wants to read, there are books on the shelf"") does not assert or confirm the existence of the books, as the condition (Susanna wanting to read) is not met. It provides no direct evidence that books are actually on the shelf, so we cannot conclude that it is true."

S1T,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo è nella gabbia. Inoltre, il cane è nella cuccia. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","Sì

The antecedent of Maria's conditional statement (""if the parrot is in the cage"") is true based on the given context. Assuming her statement holds, the consequent (""Tommaso will bring the pizza"") must also be true, meaning Tommaso has brought the pizza."
S1F,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo è nella gabbia. Inoltre, il cane è nella cuccia. Tommaso non ha portato la pizza. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","No

La risposta è no, perché il contesto stabilisce esplicitamente che Tommaso non ha portato la pizza. L'affermazione di Maria è un'implicazione logica (""Se P, allora Q""), ma con P vero (pappagallo nella gabbia) e Q falso (non ha portato la pizza), l'implicazione è falsa, ma non altera il fatto dato sul contesto."
S1C,Italian,"Ecco il contesto: Il pappagallo non è nella gabbia. Neanche il cane è nella cuccia. Maria aveva detto: ""Se il pappagallo è nella gabbia, Tommaso porterà la pizza"". In base a quello che dice Maria, è vero che Tommaso ha portato la pizza?","No

The conditional statement from Maria (""If the parrot is in the cage, then Tommaso will bring the pizza"") does not determine whether Tommaso brought the pizza when the parrot is not in the cage. The premise is false, so the implication holds vacuously, but it provides no information about the consequent. Therefore, it is not true (i.e., not entailed) that Tommaso brought the pizza. The detail about the dog is irrelevant."

B1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Juan no tiene hambre. Hay pasta en la nevera. María dice: ""Si Juan tiene hambre, hay pizza en el horno"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay pizza en el horno?","No, no es verdad que haya pizza en el horno según lo que dice María. Su afirmación es condicional: solo indica qué habría si Juan tuviera hambre, pero como no la tiene, no confirma ni niega la existencia de la pizza."
B2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. También hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","Sí, es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. El enunciado de María es una condicional verdadera (dado que Noelia tiene dolor de cabeza y hay aspirinas), y al afirmar el antecedente (el dolor de cabeza), se sigue que el consecuente (las aspirinas en la mesa) es verdadero."
B2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia le duele la cabeza y no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa. Tampoco hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No

The context explicitly states that there are no aspirins on the table (""no hay aspirinas sobre la mesa""). María's conditional statement (""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"") is false because Noelia does have a headache but there are no aspirins, but this does not change the fact that there are none."
B2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: A Noelia no le duele la cabeza. Hay ibuprofeno en el cajón. María dice: ""Si a Noelia le duele la cabeza, hay aspirinas sobre la mesa"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay aspirinas sobre la mesa?","No

María's statement is a conditional (""If Noelia has a headache, then there are aspirins on the table""). Since Noelia does not have a headache (the ""if"" part is false), the statement does not confirm or imply that there are aspirins on the table. It provides no information about their presence."
B3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y hay agua en la nevera. También hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Sí

The context establishes that Lucía is thirsty (antecedent true), and María's statement is the conditional ""If Lucía is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge"" (which is true given the facts). By modus ponens, the consequent follows: there is water in the fridge."
B3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed y no hay agua en la nevera. Tampoco hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Yes

**Explanation:**  
Lucía tiene sed (antecedente verdadero del condicional de María). María afirma: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"" (P → Q). Por modus ponens, se deduce que hay agua en la nevera, según lo que dice María."
B3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Lucía tiene sed. Hay zumo de manzana en la estantería. María dice: ""Si Lucía tiene sed, hay agua en la nevera"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay agua en la nevera?","Yes

According to María's statement (a conditional: if Lucía is thirsty, then there is water in the fridge), and given that Lucía *is* thirsty, it follows that there is water in the fridge."
B4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y hay un cargador en el cajón. También hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","Sí, es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón. La afirmación de María es una implicación condicional verdadera (dado que el antecedente es cierto y el consecuente también lo es, según el contexto proporcionado)."
B4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería y no hay ningún cargador en el cajón. Tampoco hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","Sí

**Explicación breve:** María afirma un condicional: si el móvil está sin batería (hecho verdadero), entonces hay un cargador en el cajón. Por tanto, según su afirmación, sí hay un cargador. (El contexto fáctico indica lo contrario, pero la pregunta se basa solo en lo que dice María.)"
B4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El móvil de Pedro tiene la batería llena. Hay un ordenador sobre la mesa. María dice: ""Si el móvil de Pedro se ha quedado sin batería, hay un cargador en el cajón"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un cargador en el cajón?","No

María no afirma directamente que hay un cargador en el cajón; solo lo condiciona a que la batería del móvil se haya agotado, lo cual no es el caso según el contexto (la batería está llena). Por lo tanto, según lo que dice María, no se puede concluir que el cargador esté allí."
B5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y hay un paraguas en el paragüero. También hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","Sí, es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero. Según la declaración condicional de María (Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero) y dado que el tiempo está lluvioso (como indica el contexto), se infiere que hay un paraguas en el paragüero. El contexto lo confirma directamente."
B5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está lluvioso y no hay paraguas en el paragüero. Tampoco hay ningún chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No

The context states there is no umbrella in the umbrella stand, despite the rain. Maria's conditional statement (""If it's raining, there is an umbrella"") is false because the antecedent (rain) is true but the consequent (umbrella present) is false. Thus, her statement does not make the presence of the umbrella true."
B5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El tiempo está despejado. Hay un chubasquero en el coche. María dice: ""Si el tiempo está lluvioso, hay un paraguas en el paragüero"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un paraguas en el paragüero?","No

The weather is clear (not rainy), so María's conditional statement (""If rainy, then umbrella in the stand"") is true regardless of whether an umbrella is actually there. Her words provide no information about the umbrella's presence when it's not raining, so we cannot conclude that there is one."
B6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y hay una bomba de aire en el garaje. También hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?",Sí
B6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está pinchada y no hay ninguna bomba de aire en el garaje. Tampoco hay ninguna bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","No

The facts state there is no air pump in the garage, regardless of María's conditional statement (which is false, since the tire is flat but the pump is absent). María's claim does not change the reality. The bicycle detail appears irrelevant."
B6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La rueda del coche está inflada. Hay una bicicleta junto a la puerta de entrada. María dice: ""Si la rueda del coche está pinchada, hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una bomba de aire en el garaje?","No

**Explicación breve:** La afirmación de María es una implicación condicional: ""Si la rueda está pinchada (antecedente falso, ya que está inflada), entonces hay una bomba de aire en el garaje"". Como el antecedente es falso, la implicación es verdadera independientemente del consecuente, pero no permite concluir que efectivamente haya una bomba de aire. La bicicleta es irrelevante para esta lógica."
B7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y hay un regador en la estantería. También hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","Yes

The context states that the plant is dry (true premise) and there is a watering can on the shelf (fact). María's conditional statement (""If the plant is dry, there is a watering can on the shelf"") holds true under these conditions, confirming the presence of the watering can."
B7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta está seca y no hay ningún regador en la estantería. Tampoco hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","Sí

**Explicación razonada:**  
María afirma: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Esto es una implicación lógica (si P, entonces Q), donde P = ""la planta está seca"" y Q = ""hay un regador en la estantería"".  

Según el contexto, P es verdadera (la planta está seca). Por lo tanto, según la afirmación de María, se deduce que Q también es verdadera mediante modus ponens (afirmación del antecedente).  

(Nota: El contexto factual contradice Q, pero la pregunta se centra específicamente en ""según lo que dice María"", por lo que evaluamos solo basado en su afirmación, no en la realidad externa.)"
B7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La planta no está seca. Hay una manguera en el jardín. María dice: ""Si la planta está seca, hay un regador en la estantería"". Segun lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay un regador en la estantería?","No

The conditional statement from María (""If the plant is dry, then there is a watering can on the shelf"") does not assert the existence of the watering can, as the premise (the plant being dry) is false according to the context. Therefore, her statement provides no information about whether the watering can is actually on the shelf."
B8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está arrugada y hay una plancha en el armario. También hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","Sí, es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario. (Dado que la camisa está arrugada —lo cual es cierto según el contexto— y María afirma la implicación ""si está arrugada, hay una plancha"", se deduce lógicamente que hay una plancha.)"
B8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está arrugada y no hay ninguna plancha en el armario. Tampoco hay ninguna tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","Sí

**Explicación breve:** María afirma ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"" (P → Q). Dado que la camisa está arrugada (P es verdadera), según su afirmación, se sigue que hay una plancha (Q es verdadera). (El contexto factual indica lo contrario, pero la pregunta se basa en lo que dice María.)"
B8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La camisa de Jorge está planchada. Hay una tabla de planchar en el balcón. María dice: ""Si la camisa de Jorge está arrugada, hay una plancha en el armario"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay una plancha en el armario?","No

The shirt is ironed (not wrinkled), so the condition in María's statement (""if wrinkled, then iron in the closet"") is vacuously true but does not confirm or deny the presence of an iron in the closet. We cannot conclude it is there based on her words."
B9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y hay libros en la estantería. También hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No

The statement made by María is a conditional (""If Susana wants to read, then there are books on the bookshelf""). This does not directly assert or entail that books are unconditionally on the bookshelf; it only links the presence of books to the condition of wanting to read. Without asserting that the condition is met within her statement, it does not confirm the truth of the consequent."
B9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana quiere leer y no hay libros en la estantería. Tampoco hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","Sí

**Explicación breve:** Según la afirmación de María (""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería""), y dado que Susana quiere leer, se deduce que hay libros en la estantería. El contexto fáctico es irrelevante para esta inferencia directa de su declaración."
B9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Susana no quiere leer. Hay un periódico en el sofá. María dice: ""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería"". Según lo que dice María, ¿es verdad que hay libros en la estantería?","No

**Explanation:** María's statement is a conditional (""Si Susana quiere leer, hay libros en la estantería""), que no afirma directamente la existencia de libros en la estantería. Dado que Susana no quiere leer (la condición no se cumple), no se puede concluir de sus palabras que haya libros allí. Solo sería relevante si la condición fuera verdadera, pero no lo es."
F1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque la pizza sea más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más. Hay pizza en la nevera. En este contexto, ¿la pizza es más popular que la pasta?","Sí, en el contexto dado, la pizza es más popular que la pasta, ya que la gente la compra más a pesar de ser más cara."
F1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque la pizza sea más cara que la pasta, la gente la compra más. Hay pizza en la nevera. En este contexto, ¿la pasta es más popular que la pizza?","No, la pizza es más popular que la pasta, ya que la gente la compra más a pesar de ser más cara."
F2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera. En este contexto, ¿se utiliza más el té verde que el café negro?","Sí, se utiliza más el té verde que el café negro, ya que la mayoría de la gente lo prefiere, a pesar de que el café negro sea más barato y esté disponible en la cafetera."
F2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el café negro sea más barato que el té verde, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde. Hay café negro en la cafetera. En este contexto, ¿se utiliza más el café negro que el té verde?","No, según el contexto, la mayoría de la gente prefiere el té verde a pesar de que el café negro es más barato, lo que implica que el té verde se utiliza más. El hecho de que haya café negro disponible en la cafetera no cambia la preferencia general."
F3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿los refrescos tienen más demanda que el agua?","Sí, según el contexto, los refrescos tienen más demanda que el agua, ya que mucha gente los prefiere a pesar de que el agua es más saludable. (La mención al agua en el ordenador parece irrelevante para la pregunta sobre demanda.)"
F3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el agua sea más saludable que los refrescos, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos. Hay agua en el ordenador. En este contexto, ¿el agua tiene más demanda que los refrescos?","No, según el contexto, mucha gente prefiere los refrescos a pesar de que el agua sea más saludable, por lo que los refrescos tienen más demanda. (La mención al agua en el ordenador parece un detalle irrelevante o distractor en este caso.)"
F4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más. Hay brócoli en el horno. En este contexto, ¿el brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis?","Sí, según el contexto, el brócoli es más popular que los ñoquis porque la gente lo come más, a pesar de ser más difícil de cocinar."
F4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el brócoli sea más difícil de cocinar que los ñoquis, la gente lo come más. Hay brócoli en el horno. En este contexto, ¿los ñoquis son más populare que el brócoli?","No, según el contexto, la gente come más brócoli que ñoquis, lo que implica que el brócoli es más popular."
F5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el sushi sea más sano que las hamburguesas, la gente come hamburguesas con más frecuencia. Hay sushi en la mesa. En este contexto, ¿las hamburguesas son más populares que el sushi?","Sí, según el contexto, las hamburguesas son más populares que el sushi, ya que la gente las come con más frecuencia a pesar de que el sushi es más sano."
F5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque el sushi sea más sano que las hamburguesas, la gente come hamburguesas con más frecuencia. Hay sushi en la mesa. En este contexto, ¿el sushi es más popular que las hamburguesas?","No, según el contexto proporcionado, las hamburguesas son más populares porque la gente las come con más frecuencia, a pesar de que el sushi sea más sano. La presencia de sushi en la mesa no altera esta información sobre la preferencia general."
F6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más. Hay plátanos en la cesta. En este contexto, ¿los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis?","Sí, los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis, ya que, aunque son más caros, la gente los compra más."
F6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los plátanos sean más caros que los kiwis, la gente los compra más. Hay plátanos en la cesta. En este contexto, ¿los kiwis son más populares que los platanos?","No, los plátanos son más populares que los kiwis, ya que la gente los compra más a pesar de ser más caros."

En este contexto, ¿los perros son más populares que los gatos?","Sí, según el contexto, los perros son más populares que los gatos, ya que la gente los prefiere."
F7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque los perros sean más vivaces que los gatos, la gente los prefiere. Hay un gato en lo alto del árbol. En este contexto, ¿los gatos son más populares que los perros?","No, el contexto indica que la gente prefiere a los perros sobre los gatos, lo que implica que los perros son más populares."
F8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque leer libros sea más educativo que ver la televisión, mucha gente ve la televisión. Hay un libro en la estantería. En este contexto, ¿más personas ven la televisión de las que leen libros?",Sí.

F9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Aunque correr sea mejor para la forma física que caminar, la mayoría de la gente prefiere caminar. Hay un corredor en la pista. En este contexto, ¿correr es más popular que caminar?","No, según el contexto, la mayoría de la gente prefiere caminar, por lo que es más popular que correr."
S1T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?",Sí
S1F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro está en la jaula. Además, el perro está en la caseta. Tomás no trajo pizza. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?",No
S1C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El loro no está en la jaula. Además, el perro tampoco está en la caseta. María había dicho: «Si el loro está en la jaula, Tomás traerá pizza». Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Tomás trajo pizza?","No, no se puede concluir que Tomás trajo pizza según la declaración de María, ya que el loro no está en la jaula (la condición no se cumple, por lo que la implicación no determina el resultado)."
S2T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No

The context states that you ate the broccoli, fulfilling the condition in María's statement (""If you eat the broccoli, Marcos will give you a candy""). However, it does not state or confirm that Marcos actually gave you the candy. María's words are a conditional promise for the future (""dará""), but there is no evidence in the provided information that the candy was given (""te dio,"" past tense). Therefore, it is not established as true."
S2F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Te has comido el brócoli. También te has comido la pasta. Marcos no te dio un caramelo. María dice: ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?",No
S2C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: No te has comido el brócoli. Tampoco te has comido la pasta. María había dicho:  ""Si te comes el brócoli, Marcos te dará un caramelo"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Marcos te dio un caramelo?","No

The conditional statement from María (""If you eat the broccoli, Marcos will give you a candy"") implies that receiving the candy is contingent on eating the broccoli. Since you did not eat the broccoli, Marcos did not give you the candy."
S3T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?","No

The given context and María's conditional statement imply that Irene (not Susana) receives a camera, since the foxes are dancing. Nothing indicates that Susana received one."
S3F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros están bailando. Además, las ardillas están comiendo. Irene no recibió una cámara. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Susana recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Irene recibió una cámara?",No.
S3C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Los zorros no están bailando. Las ardillas tampoco están comiendo. María había dicho: ""Si los zorros están bailando, Irene recibirá una cámara"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Susana recibió una cámara?",No
S4T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","Sí, es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas."
S4F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está encendida. Además, la radio también está encendida. Mateo no hizo galletas. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?","No

The context explicitly states that Mateo did not make cookies (""Mateo no hizo galletas""), making the claim false regardless of María's statement. María's conditional (""If TV is on, then Mateo makes cookies"") is contradicted by the facts (TV on, no cookies), but the question asks directly about whether Mateo made cookies, not about the validity of María's statement."
S4C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La televisión está apagada. La radio también está apagada. María había dicho: ""Si la televisión está encendida, Mateo hará galletas"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Mateo hizo galletas?",No. La declaración de María es una implicación condicional que no proporciona información sobre si Mateo hizo galletas cuando la televisión está apagada. No hay datos suficientes para afirmar que lo hizo.
S5T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","Sí, es verdad que Emma fue de morado."
S5F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está soleado. Además, no hay viento. Emma fue de verde. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?",No
S5C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: Hoy el tiempo está lluvioso. Además, hay mucho viento. María había dicho: ""Si el tiempo está soleado, Emma va a ir de morado"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Emma fue de morado?","No

The conditional statement from María (""If sunny, then Emma wears purple"") only applies if the weather is sunny. Since it's rainy (not sunny), the condition isn't met, so there's no basis to conclude Emma wore purple."
S6T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","Sí, según la afirmación de María y el hecho de que el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hizo un selfie."
S6F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está vacío. Además, las calles están tranquilas. Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No

**Explanation:** El contexto indica explícitamente que ""Júlia no se hizo ningún selfie"". Aunque María dijo que lo haría si el parque infantil está vacío (lo cual es cierto), esto no cambia el hecho dado en el contexto. La afirmación de María es falsa, pero la pregunta es sobre si Júlia se hizo un selfie, y la respuesta es no."
S6C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El parque infantil está lleno. Además, las calles están concurridas. María había dicho: ""Si el parque infantil está vacío, Júlia se hará un selfie"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Júlia se hizo un selfie?","No

The conditional statement from María (""If the playground is empty, Júlia will take a selfie"") only specifies what happens if the condition (empty playground) is met. Since the playground is full, the condition is not satisfied, and María's statement provides no information about whether Júlia took a selfie in that case. Therefore, it is not true (based on the given information) that Júlia took a selfie."
S7T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No. El césped fue cortado, pero no se especifica que Pablo lo haya hecho, por lo que no se puede concluir que reciba los 50 euros según la declaración de María."
S7F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped ha sido cortado. Además, las flores han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?","No

The conditional statement from María (""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"") requires that Pablo specifically be the one who cuts the grass to trigger the payment. The context states only that the grass has been cut (passive voice, without specifying who did it), so there is insufficient information to conclude that Pablo cut it or therefore received the 50 euros. The detail about the flowers being watered is irrelevant."
S7C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El césped no ha sido cortado. Además, las flores no han sido regadas. María había dicho: ""Si Pablo corta el césped, recibirá 50 euros"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Pablo recibió 50 euros?",No.
S8T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","Sí, es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro."
S8F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro está jugando. Además, el gato está subiendo al árbol. Antonio no leyó ningún libro. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No

The context explicitly states that Antonio did not read any book (""Antonio no leyó ningún libro""). María's conditional statement (""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"") predicts that he would read one given the dog is playing, but this prediction does not change the factual statement that he did not. Thus, it is not true that Antonio read a book."
S8C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: El perro no está jugando. Además, el gato está durmiendo. María había dicho: ""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Antonio leyó un libro?","No

The conditional statement (""Si el perro está jugando, Antonio leerá un libro"") solo obliga a que Antonio lea un libro si el perro está jugando. Dado que el perro no está jugando, no hay información que confirme que Antonio leyó un libro. La mención del gato durmiendo es irrelevante."
S9T,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","Sí, según lo que dijo María, es verdad que Ana trajo donuts, ya que la nevera está vacía y su afirmación era condicional."
S9F,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está vacía. Además, el horno está estropeado. Ana no trajo donuts. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No

The context explicitly states that Ana did not bring donuts (""Ana no trajo donuts""), so the statement that she did is false. María's conditional statement (""If the fridge is empty, Ana will bring donuts"") is contradicted by the facts but does not change the direct evidence provided."
S9C,Spanish,"Aquí tienes el contexto: La nevera está llena. Además, el horno está encendido. María había dicho: ""Si la nevera está vacía, Ana traerá donuts"". Según lo que decía María, ¿es verdad que Ana trajo donuts?","No

The statement from María is a conditional: if the fridge is empty (P), then Ana brings donuts (Q). The fridge is full (¬P), so the condition P is false. This means the conditional does not apply, and there is no information indicating that Q occurred. Therefore, it is not true that Ana brought donuts."
